### 三、详情
<p><strong><em>Kiss me where it smells funny!</em></strong></p><p>This is a very personal upload with a little background story: some days ago i had a short argument with another civitai user. At the end (s)he told me, that i had made the most pointless and disturbing model on civitai (referring to my <em>Licking Armpit Poses</em> upload). That hurt ... a bit.</p><p>So what was the only logical thing to do? Yes, exactly, upload something similarly pointless and disturbing, then at least one of those downloads would definitely not be the most pointless and disturbing anymore. Thus it is an honor for me to present to you: Rimming poses for controlnet's openpose, normal and softedge models. Hf :)</p><p></p><p>1.0: Wow, standing backwards is a hard thing to do. Well, at least for some checkpoints. Although <em>URPM</em> has been my go to base model for the realistic depiction of sex from the beginning, this made me searching for alternatives (have a look at <em>suggested resources</em>). So, with the right checkpoint consistency is quite bearable.</p><p>I added two openpose variants of the pose as the median distance between butt and face seems to differ from checkpoint to checkpoint. Jokes aside, hopefully it gives you another option if a base model decides to not place the face where it should be for successful buttmunching. Usually <em>Balanced</em> and a weight of 1.0-1.5 seems to work best for openpose.</p><p>For the other two types it might be neccessary to experiement a bit more with the controlnet settings, usually you can/should decrease the weight quite a bit with them.</p><p>As always: best used with 3:2/2:3 resolutions.</p><p></p><p><em>2nd part of my CIA - Controlnet Is Awesome collection.
