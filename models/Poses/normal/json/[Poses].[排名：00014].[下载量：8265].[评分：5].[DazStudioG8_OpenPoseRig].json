{"id": 13478, "name": "DazStudioG8_OpenPoseRig", "description": "<h3>G8 OpenPoseRig, Final version, (barring bug fixes), V1.0</h3><p>Bunch of QOL fixes.</p><p>Eliminated the 'prop bones' and managed keep the torso from exploding without them, should make it more suitable for exporting. Very weird poses can cause the torso bones to stick out at the neck but who bends both forward and backwards at the same time eh?</p><p>Some quality of life refinements on the icons. Improved the skeleton thickness options. More shaping morphs, most proprtions can be adjusted in some way. If theres something you can't get it to do try scaling the bones individually.</p><p> It will fit to G8F without complaint now. If you add extreme morphs the skeleton mesh will distort due to the morph projection not being able to get a 1:1 correlation but it will be usable for most things, even if it is a bit lumpy. Honestly you're better off matching the proportions using the sliders without fitting it, then saving that as a pose/morph preset.</p><p>Anyway, here it is, as the French say.</p><p>.................................</p><p></p><p>I suck at tutorials, so if anyone can write up a good work flow please do so.

Scale doesn't matter with lone figures but use the overall figure scale to get different comparable sizes.</p><p> If you want to get it into an existing scene, for now I'd suggest saving the file with only the figure in it and then merging it into your existing scene. You can then duplicate the figure as many times as you need and apply pose presets created from your existing characters.</p><p>There's probably a better workflow that you'll find about ten minutes after you needed it.</p><p>Like I said, it's a bit of a hack so sequential saving recommended. Janky AF sometimes.</p><p>If there's enough interest I'll see about putting a proper figure package together, it's been a while since I did one though so that might take a bit of effort.</p><p></p>", "stats": {"downloadCount": 838, "ratingCount": 3, "rating": 5}, "files": [{"name": "dazstudiog8_v06.zip", "id": 13546, "sizeKB": 633.3408203125, "type": "Archive", "metadata": {"format": "Other"}, "pickleScanResult": "Success", "pickleScanMessage": "No Pickle imports", "virusScanResult": "Success", "scannedAt": "2023-02-26T21:51:17.820Z", "hashes": {"AutoV2": "3737427686", "SHA256": "3737427686EE9C7F3B290DC0BB2DB28118B0D30EF1B77C4E46F280C55D43CE1D", "CRC32": "DAA47326", "BLAKE3": "339767CD69998D61416EDEBF111EA789A3F1EF01B1229478B27CBE0A16EAE240"}, "downloadUrl": "https://civitai.com/api/download/models/15879", "primary": true}], "images": [{"id": 159780, "url": "https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/f71cf336-3cad-42af-4814-a2c298f59d00/width=450/159780.jpeg", "nsfw": "None", "width": 1280, "height": 720, "hash": "UC8qa0-s^-s=yEs=t8ogTJNFNFWUTdWTk8j?", "meta": {"prompt": "Zero Pose"}}, {"id": 159779, "url": "https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/e3d72832-679b-48bb-0bf8-f02d0e1cfd00/width=450/159779.jpeg", "nsfw": "None", "width": 1280, "height": 720, "hash": "UC8z}t-?_4t9%#fnxuj^X,InW9R%TcWUWTkB", "meta": {"prompt": "Pose Applied"}}, {"id": 159778, "url": "https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/ccd7b83e-ae48-49a6-ae65-b360f7b87400/width=450/159778.jpeg", "nsfw": "None", "width": 512, "height": 704, "hash": "U01V@^-C4T5h=qwfEmFHHaN1uf%G5uNc,+-Q", "meta": {"prompt": "Iray Render"}}, {"id": 159777, "url": "https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/eb4ba4f0-8987-40cc-ec80-7421b768be00/width=450/159777.jpeg", "nsfw": "None", "width": 512, "height": 704, "hash": "U01fez=y4T0_=VxFE.EhD6Itug%G5^I?+;?A", "meta": {"prompt": "OpenGL Render"}}, {"id": 159776, "url": "https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/717b92cb-e9be-451b-2631-293710346200/width=450/159776.jpeg", "nsfw": "None", "width": 512, "height": 704, "hash": "U01fez=y4T0_]{xFE.EhD6Itug-j5wI?,7?9", "meta": {"prompt": "3DL Render"}}, {"id": 159775, "url": "https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/26548507-5a2d-4790-929c-536990511c00/width=450/159775.jpeg", "nsfw": "None", "width": 512, "height": 704, "hash": "U01p3Y,^001W^FwKA2BTHZN1qD%G5dNw=A=Z", "meta": {"prompt": "Viewport Render"}}, {"id": 160077, "url": "https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/f22461ce-0e9e-43aa-ef94-67b92e0a8e00/width=450/160077.jpeg", "nsfw": "X", "width": 640, "height": 880, "hash": "U6GuU%~V00?0{2^,KQNH=dMz0dE001V[%KE0", "meta": {"Size": "512x704", "seed": 2274216250, "Model": "XPBlend230119", "steps": 20, "prompt": "modern disney style, woman with those_eyes in skintight leather suit, rain, eyeshadow, intricate, beautiful,  <lora:modernDisneyLORA_modiV1:0.4> , by roguepilot deviantart", "sampler": "Euler a", "cfgScale": 7, "resources": [{"name": "modernDisneyLORA_modiV1", "type": "lora", "weight": 0.4}, {"hash": "4d48fac3fd", "name": "XPBlend230119", "type": "model"}], "Model hash": "4d48fac3fd", "Hires upscale": "1.25", "Hires upscaler": "Latent (bicubic antialiased)", "negativePrompt": "((selfie)), (perfect:0.3) (symmetry:0.15), (symmetrical:0.15), (anime:0.4), (DreamArtistBADHAND-neg:0.3), Polydactyly, (Unspeakable-Horrors-Composition-4v:0.5), ((tattoos)), inflammation under eyes, (monochrome), (open mouth)", "ControlNet-0 Model": "diff_control_sd15_openpose_fp16 [1723948e]", "Denoising strength": "0.53", "ControlNet-0 Module": "none", "ControlNet-0 Weight": "1.25", "ControlNet-0 Enabled": "True", "ControlNet-0 Guidance Strength": "1"}}], "downloadUrl": "https://civitai.com/api/download/models/15879"}]}
