### 三、详情
<p>This is a collection of openpose poses for running and walking. The collection contains openpose poses from 8 different angles for 4 different animations, a normal running animation, a normal walking animation, a girlish running animation, and a woman walking animation.</p><p></p><p>Inside the zip file, there are 8 folders. Each folder corresponds to a direction (the direction that the character is running towards in the animation). <br />T = Top</p><p>R = Right</p><p>L = Left</p><p>B = Bottom</p><p>TR = Top Right</p><p><br />TL = Top Left</p><p>BR = Bottom Right</p><p>BL = Bottom Left</p><p><br />The poses are intended for use with ControlNet. Extract the zip file containing the poses and load the intended pose in the ControlNet extension and set preprocessor to none (if you are using Automatic1111) or provide the loaded image as input to the ControlNetApply node (if you are using ComfyUI). <br /></p><p>The images were generated by rotating animated 3d models and using openpose to generate the openpose bones for the animations from different angles. There are 2 different collections provided, one contains the base images as they came out of openpose (1920 by 1080 or 1280 by 720 size depending on the animation). The other collection contains cropped versions that are 512 by 512. The 512 by 512 crops are not always perfect (but the majority of them are good) so if you face any issues with them, you can use the full resolution collection and create better crops. (Might upload better cropped versions later since I am not satisfied with the top direction crops for the normal walking animation and normal running animation.) <br /><br />The poses for each direction contain between 50 to 80 images. The open pose generations had a lot of results and I decided to I uploaded all frames so that anyone using the poses can decide which frames are best and how many frames they want to use.</p><p></p>
