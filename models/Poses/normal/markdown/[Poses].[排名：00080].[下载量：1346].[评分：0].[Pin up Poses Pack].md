### 三、详情
<p>This is a new set of Pin up poses to the collection. This set contains a total of 25 different kind of pin up poses, each pose has been captured from 25 different angles, giving you a wide range of options.</p><p>Please keep in mind that due to the more dynamic poses or angles, some images may need to be resized to fit your specific needs.</p><p></p><p>All the images in the set are in png format with the background removed, making it possible to use multiple images in a single scene without worrying about overlapping backgrounds. Additionally, the Controlnet system does not require a background to use the images, so they can be imported as they are.</p><p>If you want to be more safe on the image generation with poses, you can use any image editing software to add the black background on the back of the poses.</p><p></p><p>Some poses may be too far from the scene and require zooming in for stable diffusion to capture them properly.</p><p>Some poses in the set, such as those with extreme angles like top-down or bottom-right upward views, may be challenging for stable diffusion to comprehend without additional prompts support. If stable diffusion is unable to understand or generate these extreme poses, it is advisable to move on and try other poses.</p><p></p><p>In this set some poses can cause stable diffusion very hard to understand for example the upside down pose is a very difficult one. You may need more experiment with poses that could be rare in the data base.</p>
