### 三、详情
<p>Based on the visual essence of an adult streaming personality who looks similiar. Not the best, but good enough for a meme or two.</p><p></p><p>This is not plug and play. Always use a good negative embedding and these strengthening keywords: redhead hair, wavy redhead hair, long redhead hair, evocative, alluring, posing for a picture.</p><p>I used <em>redhead </em>so the color red/orange wasn't heavy.</p><p>Others: bikini, inflatable pool, staring at the camera, excited, cute expression, smirking, exposed breasts</p><p></p><p>Without keywords it will be probably be a lookalike figure. Not all models work. If she doesn't show up, switch to other realistic vision mixes or mess with CFG between 5-9.</p><p>If you want SFW images you're going to want to use a SFW model. Theoretically this could have been trained on things from her thing. </p><p><u>This was trained with Tile Diffusion in mind</u>, so it's recommended. Somewhat of an experiment that shows promise. If you don't use it you will get close ups on just her body since it was trained on square closeups of all parts of her so TD can use the references, but it still works for portraits and controlnet. Works well with img2img and inpainting if txt is not working.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
