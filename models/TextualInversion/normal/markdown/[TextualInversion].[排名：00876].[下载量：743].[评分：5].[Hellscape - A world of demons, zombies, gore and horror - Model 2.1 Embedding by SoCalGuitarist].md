<p>This is <strong>Hellscape</strong>, a world stuck in time after the gates of hell swung wide! Hellscape has been several weeks and over 100 hours in the making, with multiple revisions to try to make it as flexible and coherent as possible, while still delivering on the demonic vision I set out to achieve.</p><p></p><p><strong>Hellscape </strong>delivers bleak yet atmospheric vistas, deteriorating infrastructure and oh yeah, demons and zombies and all sorts of other nasty ghoulies. If you're making zombies, use expressive words like "rotting flesh rancid meat bloated corpse" to really pile on the effects (careful, it can get downright gross if you push it too far!) while demons really react well to flavor words like "terror, fear, hopelessness, blight" and other apocalyptic delights.</p><p></p><p><strong>Hellscape </strong>was also trained on anatomically correct training images, so it's also pretty good at knowing what a human nipple looks like... For best results for females, "nude with her breasts exposed" will typically land you proper nipples, though you may still need to neg clothing and "pasties" if it's fighting you. #freethenipple</p><p></p><p>I want to give special thanks to my friend <a rel="ugc" href="https://twitter.com/masslevel">masslevel </a>for helping me conceptualize, test, refine, and improve Hellscape over the many hours of revisions and re-dos! He also donated many of the great images used for the listing here. Check him out on twitter, he does some really amazing things in the latent space!</p><p></p><p><strong>NOTE - Hellscape comes on pretty strong - if you're finding it looks "burnt", try running it with a lower CFG around the 4 - 5 range, and you can also try de-emphasizing Hellscape to about 75% strength, like this: (Hellscape768:0.75)</strong></p><p></p><p>As with all of my other embeds, <strong>Hellscape</strong> has been designed to be as flexible and cohesive as possible. It responds best to short prompts, and it mixes nicely with my <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/1582/socalguitarist-cinema768-embeddings-digital-analog-classic-bandw-easy-movie-scenes-for-2x-models">Cinema768 series</a>, especially the digital and analog variants. <strong>Hellscape </strong>also responds well to my <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/2385/socalguitarists-magic-facelift-negative-embedding-for-model-2x-fix-yo-ugly-faces">Fix yo' ugly Face Facelift embedding</a>, however fair warning, if you want you want ugly monsters, leave Facelift on the sideline! You can find all of my other <strong>high quality </strong>embeddings on my<a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/SoCalGuitarist"> profile page</a>, follow me to be notified when I release new embeddings!</p><p></p><p>--------</p><p><strong>To use this embedding in AUTOMATIC1111, copy it to your embeddings folder in your stable-diffusion-webui directory. No need to restart, just invoke the embedding from your prompt. Make sure you are using a compatible model or you will get errors!</strong></p><p>--------</p>
