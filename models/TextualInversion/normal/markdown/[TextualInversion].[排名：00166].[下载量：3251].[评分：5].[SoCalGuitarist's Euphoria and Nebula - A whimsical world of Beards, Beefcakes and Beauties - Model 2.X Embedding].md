### 三、详情
<p>Meet <strong>Euphoria and Nebula</strong>, sibling embeddings from the same training that create beautiful dreamlike imagery with extreme detail, gorgeous lighting and a whimsical "lived in" feeling that I hope will make my embeddings your new favorite!</p><p><strong>Nebula</strong> delivers gorgeous thick brush stroke painted environments, steampunk-esque vehicles and cities and dreamy locales and people. <strong>Euphoria </strong>is a portrait maker, delivering extremely detailed Pixar/Disney/Dreamworks style high end render style portraits with that same streak of whimsy.</p><p>Where both Nebula and Euphoria really shine is with inpainting. <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://imagecache.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/948c94ce-f512-4e4c-71a6-79bdf8a6b300/width=2487">Inpaint at full resolution and watch the magic happen</a>. Several (though not all) of the sample images have had some light inpainting, including adding detail to faces and hands. Also, all of the sample images on this page use my special <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/2385/socalguitarists-magic-facelift-negative-embedding-for-model-2x-fix-yo-ugly-faces">Fix Yo' Face neg_FaceLift768 negative embedding</a>. I highly recommend it, along with all of my other <strong>high quality </strong>embeddings you can find on my<a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/SoCalGuitarist"> profile page</a>. Follow me to be notified when I release new embeddings!</p><p>💖💖I hope you enjoy using these embeddings in your art as much as I enjoy creating them for the Stable Diffusion community. 🙏🏼🙏🏼If you do like them, can you pretty please <u>click the heart</u> at the top and leave a review? Many thanks! 💖💖</p><p></p><p><strong><u>Versions</u></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>SCG768-Nebula - </strong>Thick paint strokes, colorful yet cool, with a flair for the dramatic. Creates beautiful, lived in environments with ease. Expect lots of beards and muscles, neg both "bear" and "beard" to tame the masculinity a bit, and neg "chibi" for a more serious, less cute style.</p><p></p><p><strong>SCG768-Euphoria - </strong>Beautiful, detailed portraits with dreamy 'lived in' environments with a fun organic feel. Favors beards, beefcakes and beautiful faces, but is flexible enough to be used in a variety of imagery from photorealistic to painted fantasy.</p><p></p><p><strong>NOTE - </strong>Euphoria is pretty rigid and stubborn, and may put up more of a fight to get the results you want than any of my other embeddings. I find it works best to be descriptive about locations for your scenes or you're going to almost always get some variation of a fantasy city background. Euphoria does portraits best, that's what its designed to do. The more you push it out of its comfort the zone the more it will fight you, but the more you may find <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://imagecache.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/e27427a8-bb93-4df3-0af3-f39400405300/width=768">unexpected beauty</a>. Good luck!</p><p>---------</p><p><strong>A note on the creation of these embeddings</strong></p><p>Both Nebula and Euphoria are hybrid embeddings. Both of these embeddings were trained on a curated selection of AI generated images I created through a mixture of prompt crafting and embeddings. From that training, I then used direct textual inversion to modify and improve the output of the embeddings.</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>To use these embeddings in AUTOMATIC1111, copy them to your embeddings folder in your stable-diffusion-webui directory. No need to restart, just invoke the embedding from your prompt. Make sure you are using a compatible model or you will get errors!</strong></p><p>--------</p>
