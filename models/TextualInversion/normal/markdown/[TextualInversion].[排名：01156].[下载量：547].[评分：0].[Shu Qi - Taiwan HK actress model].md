<h1>Shu Qi - Taiwan/HK actress and model</h1><p>It took me a LOT of tries but I think I've got a decent Shu Qi (chinese 舒淇) textual inversion to offer you. Shu Qi is best known to western audiences as the gal in the first Transporter movie. She started her career doing softcore movies like Sex and Zen but moved quickly to more mainstream movies. She was in the final running for Zhang Ziyi's role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and starred opposite Jackie Chan in Gorgeous. On top of garnering a number of acting awards, she's still a staple of Asian fashion magazines and commercials. This TI represents her look from about about 2005-2015. I might do another one for her very early period.</p><p></p><p>About the TI, this is trained on 44 images against 3 vectors. It took a long time to figure out because I kept overtraining and later discovered the best takes were VERY low in the training process (like only 1300 steps). It was trained using SD1.5, pretty standard.</p><p></p><p>Intended for use with a photorealistic model, I get good likenesses of Shu Qi using RealisticVision1.3, adjust the weighting as needed up to 1.2-1.3 depending on your surrounding prompt.</p><p></p><p>As you can see from examples, her look is versatile, whether doing a red carpet render, a John Woo type action movie, or in the bedroom for a different type of action...</p><p></p><p>Download and drop the <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="http://broc-shuqi.pt">broc-shuqi.pt</a> file in your ..\stable-diffusion-webui\embeddings folder and add the name of the file (without the .pt part) to your prompt to activate. You can of course change the name of the file to whatever you want and use that for your prompt instead if you prefer.</p>
