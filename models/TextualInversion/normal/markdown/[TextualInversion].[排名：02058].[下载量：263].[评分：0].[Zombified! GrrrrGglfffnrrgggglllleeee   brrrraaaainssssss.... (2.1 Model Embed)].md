<p><strong>Zombified768</strong> is a quick and easy way to add zombies to anything. Want to img2img a famous painting and zombify it? ✅  Want to generate a hyperrealistic mob of drooling zombies running towards you? ✅ Want an incredibly powerful negative embed enhancer that delivers stunningly gorgeous output ironically enough? ✅ Want to mix zombies into any other embed? Yep, it'll do that too! ✅ <strong>Zombified768</strong> is incredibly good at creating slobbering, rotting, ugly disgusting zombies. </p><p></p><p>Just like all of my other <strong>high quality </strong>embeddings, <strong>Zombified768</strong> is very easy to use. To zombify any existing image, add <strong>Zombify768 </strong>to your prompt all by its lonesome in the img2img tab along with your input image. It doesn't need any other other instructions, though if you're going to use it on a famous person, you can add their name if you want to retain more of their likeness as you amp up the zombification. Now, set your denoiser strength in the 0.5 to 0.6 range and let 'er rip! I've found once you get past the .6 to .65 range, it will start to get creative and start to lose the likeness of the original image, but that's not always a bad thing!</p><p></p><p><strong>NOTE - Zombified768 comes on pretty strong - if you're finding it looks "burnt", try running it with a lower CFG around the 4 - 5 range, and you can also try de-emphasizing it to about 75% strength, like this: (Zombified768:0.75)</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Zombified768 </strong>is designed for img2img, but it can be coaxed into creating incredibly realistic (and disgusting) zombie imagery in txt2img as well, though be warned, you must be very descriptive or you will get blank backgrounds and close up portrait style images. You can make it dance if you push hard enough! <strong>Zombified768</strong> mixes nicely with my <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/1582/socalguitarist-cinema768-embeddings-digital-analog-classic-bandw-easy-movie-scenes-for-2x-models">Cinema768 series</a>, especially the digital and analog variants. You can find all of my other <strong>high quality </strong>embeddings on my<a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/SoCalGuitarist"> profile page</a>, follow me to be notified when I release new embeddings!</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>Heads up -</strong> This one can get pretty gross and gory, and it does nudity pretty decently as it's related to my <a rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/6505/hellscape-a-world-of-demons-zombies-gore-and-horror-model-21-embedding-by-socalguitarist">Hellscape </a>embedding, which I trained on proper anatomy... That being said, may not want to show this one to the younger crowd, as it can potentially be a nightmare generator. Fair warning!</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>To use this embedding in AUTOMATIC1111, copy it to your embeddings folder in your stable-diffusion-webui directory. No need to restart, just invoke the embedding from your prompt. Make sure you are using a compatible model or you will get errors!</strong></p><p>--------</p>
