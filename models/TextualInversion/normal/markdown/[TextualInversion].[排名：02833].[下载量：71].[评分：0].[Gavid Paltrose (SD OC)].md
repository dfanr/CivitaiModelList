### 三、详情
<p>Gavid first found fame as the hard rocking front-man of seminal 80's LA rock band 'Gans &amp; Posers'. Then he met and married model <a rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/49742/bilphanie-mourberg-sd-oc">Bilphanie Mourberg</a>, and things got a little weird. First they decided to name their daughter "Grapefruit", then they announced to the world they had decided to "consciously uncouple", and finally Gavid dropped the bombshell news he was leaving the band. Since then he's reinvented himself as a successful (and ever-changing) solo artist. Now he's ready to feature in your SD creations. As a minor side-note ... Gavid doesn't exist, and is an AI OC, a character not based on any living person, in personality or looks. Gavid may LOOK like somebody you know, but he's a Nobody.<br /><br />He's happy to be your hard-rock hero, your gnarly barbarian, or homeless bum, when you need a consistent character not based on any one living person. He works in every model I've tested (which is quite a few), likes to keep his hair long, and seems to wear a permanent scowl (so appropriate prompts will be needed to make him smile).</p><p></p><p>Inspired by <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/Zovya">Zovya's</a> <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/tag/nobody">Nobody</a> series.
