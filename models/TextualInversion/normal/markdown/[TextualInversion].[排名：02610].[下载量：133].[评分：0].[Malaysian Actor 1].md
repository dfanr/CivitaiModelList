<p>This is my first time publishing textual inversion and most of my work before is for personal usage only. I have tried to search through this website and cannot find any textual inversion targeting Southeast Asian girls and that's why I started to build one that comes from Southeast Asian actors. Train with chilloutmix and work best when including the model name in front of the prompt. </p><p>As a sample, you may use something like this:<br /></p><pre><code>malaysianActor1V1, a woman posing for a photo, 1girl,(platinum blonde hair):1.3, long hair, curls_hairstyle:0.6, (red plaid dress), good hand,4k, high-res, masterpiece, best quality,((Hasselblad photography)), finely detailed skin, sharp focus, (cinematic lighting), collarbone, night, soft lighting, dynamic angle, [:(detailed face:1.2):0.2],(((5 stars hotel))), outside, &lt;lora:curls_hairstyle:0.3&gt;</code></pre><p><strong>DISCLAIMER!!</strong></p><p>The following textual inversion represents a fictional portrayal of a real Malaysian actor and has been created solely for entertainment purposes.
