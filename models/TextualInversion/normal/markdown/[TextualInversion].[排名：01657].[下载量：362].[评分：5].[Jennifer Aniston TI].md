### 三、详情
<p>A few weeks ago (which in rapid SD time... is a long time ago), I raised a fuss on a few Checkpoint/Dreambooth models built of images of a single person, pointing out that TIs were better and significantly smaller. Feedback was mixed, and the #1 complaint was "TI's don't look as good" I offered to train a TI on the same images used. <span data-type="mention" class="mantine-1yiar0p" data-id="mention:96" data-label="malcolmrey">@malcolmrey</span> was kind enough to take me up on the offer, and posted his training images for a few of the celebs he'd done. I finally got around to doing the comparison, and as I expected, the TIs looked better, IMHO. This is so people can compare on their own... <br /><br />TIs do have some flaws about using the person in ways not trained (there are ways around this, including better training images). I didn't attempt to do this for this experiment, so asking for Jen riding a bicycle might yield her standing around instead. That's fixable, but not done in this case. (You can often cheat by asking for things like "A woman who looks like Jen, riding a bicycle" and other 'indirect' methods, but really it's better to just train less 'tight' TIs.)<br /></p><img src="https://imagecache.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/c7b496cc-a1c2-4f1e-c06a-02b763351900/width=525" /><p><br />So I posted this to the Civitai Discord, and asked people to guess which was which: Identify Mystery 1,2,3,4 with Stock 1.5 Jennifer, CKPT sks (the CKPT <span data-type="mention" class="mantine-1yiar0p" data-id="mention:96" data-label="malcolmrey">@malcolmrey</span> posted), my TI-1000 steps and my TI-3500 steps<br /><br />(answer is below... make your guesses first)<br /><br />I also did a 2.x TI, which I'll include a few samples of as well...<br /><br />I've uploaded a very big pile of other steps for both 15 and 2.x (as embedded pngs), to the 2.x-4500, as 'training data' (the actual training data is on Malcolm's CKPT upload) for those who want to try a bunch out and see how the TI changes over training... OR if one of them is better than the 4 I specifically pulled out here to add one by one...</p><p>Drop any of the pngs into your embedding folder, and they work just like .pt files otherwise.<br /><br />Thanks to Malcolm and also to <span data-type="mention" class="mantine-1yiar0p" data-id="mention:1" data-label="justmaier">@justmaier</span> for his support. Shout outs to all of the crew on the Discord too. Also to ALL of the amazing TI creators who have started posting TIs since my initial rant/complaints. TIs have proven themselves.<br /><br />(the order, BTW, is 1000, Stock1.5, 3500, and Malcolm's CKPT - same (1 randomly picked) seed, same steps, CFG and TI changed, that's all)</p>
