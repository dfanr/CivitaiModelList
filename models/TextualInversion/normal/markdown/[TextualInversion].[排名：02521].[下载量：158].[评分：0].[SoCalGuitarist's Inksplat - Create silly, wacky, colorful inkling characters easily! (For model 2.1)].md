<p>It's chaotic, it's messy, It's fun... It's <strong>Inksplat</strong>! Based off of the Inkling art style popularized by the Splatoon video game series on Nintendo Switch, this embedding creates wacky colorful characters with big chibi eyes, toothy grins and action poses. </p><p></p><p>💖💖I hope you enjoy using these embeddings in your art as much as I enjoy creating them for the Stable Diffusion community. 🙏🏼🙏🏼If you do like them, can you pretty please <u>click the heart</u> at the top and leave a review? Many thanks! 💖💖</p><p></p><p>As with my other <strong>high quality </strong>embeddings, <strong>Inksplat </strong>is designed to be easy to use and only requires small prompts to make it "do the thing" - That said, <strong>Inksplat </strong>is more chaotic than most of my other embeds, as the nature of the art style is supposed to be kind of all over the place. I've found it mixes beautifully with my other embeds, especially <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/3163/socalguitarists-euphoria-and-nebula-a-whimsical-world-of-beards-beefcakes-and-beauties-model-2x-embedding">Euphoria </a>and <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/4322/socalguitarists-bliss-create-stunning-hand-painted-scenes-with-ease-model-21-embedding">Bliss</a>. Also, all of the sample images on this page use my special <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/2385/socalguitarists-magic-facelift-negative-embedding-for-model-2x-fix-yo-ugly-faces">Fix yo' ugly face!

Follow me to be notified when I release new embeddings!</p><p></p><p>I want to give a shoutout to <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AiAdventurer">/u/AIAdventurer on reddit</a>, if not for his <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/107ocn0/swooosh_why_are_inklings_so_expressive_im/">3 paragraph prompt on how to make these things originally</a>, I never would have been able to get this project off the ground. 🙏🏼🙏🏼</p><p></p><p><strong>-- A special note on Inklings and skin tone --</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Inksplat</strong> is more rigid than my typical embeds, mostly because the style is so unique. Sadly, this also makes it more difficult to produce subjects that are outside of the typical "chibi/inkling character with light skin and funny colored hair". I put special effort into trying to make this embed more inclusive during the training process by including dark skinned inkling training subjects, as I found there is very little minority representation in Inkling art (seriously, search google for "black African American Inkling"). Even so, the style really prefers light skin colors, but you can force darker skin using prompt terms like "African American black &lt;subject&gt; with tanned dark black skin". <u>To be clear</u>, I am ultimately not happy with how much effort it takes to create dark skin inklings, and will continue working on a more inclusive version that doesn't fight so hard against darker skin tones. My intention is to create tools for everybody to use!</p><p>---------</p><p><strong>Inksplat </strong>is a hybrid embedding. It was created through  a merge of multiple trainings on a variety of AI generated <strong>Inksplat </strong>characters and pure textual inversion through token crafting.</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>To use these embeddings in AUTOMATIC1111, copy them to your embeddings folder in your stable-diffusion-webui directory. No need to restart, just invoke the embedding from your prompt. Make sure you are using a compatible model or you will get errors!</strong></p><p>--------</p>
