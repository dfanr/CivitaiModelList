<p><strong>Maxfield Parrish</strong> (July 25, 1870 – March 30, 1966) was an American painter and <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illustration">illustrator</a> active in the first half of the 20th century. He is known for his distinctive saturated hues and idealized neo-classical imagery. His career spanned fifty years and was wildly successful: the <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_American_Illustration">National Museum of American Illustration</a> deemed his painting <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_(painting)"><em>Daybreak</em></a> (1922) to be the most successful art print of the 20th century.</p><p></p><p>This is my very first style embedding so maybe don't expect perfect results. I recommend using " a painting of" and Dreamshaper model for better results. Feel free to test and manifest your opinion. It certainly will be helpful.</p><p></p><p>Differences of using "Maxfield Parrish style" vs using this embedding:</p><ul><li><p>With the embedding you have lot more detail using the same prompts. Better textures. Better skin. More complex landscapes. </p></li><li><p>SD.1.5 images have a yellow cast inclination that is corrected in the embeddings. Although Parrish uses a lot of yellowish tones in some of his paintings, it's certainly not as prevalent.</p></li><li><p>SD  1.5 oversaturates colours. </p></li></ul><p></p><p>Of course feel free to comment and suggest more embeddings.</p><p>If you like my embeddings, please consider to support my work in <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://ko-fi.com/punkimaster">https://ko-fi.com/punkimaster</a></p>
