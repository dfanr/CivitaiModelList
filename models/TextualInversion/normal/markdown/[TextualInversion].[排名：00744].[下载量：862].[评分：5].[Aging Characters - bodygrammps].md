<p>This will age characters.</p><p>I needed some embedding for some aging transitions i wanted to do so i put this together. Hopefully it's useful for someone else.</p><p>It's not trained but more of an embedding hack-together, poking at tokens and messing with their weights. </p><p>It will try to age characters <strong>a lot</strong> sometimes. This was done on purpose, so it doesn't get easily overpowered on complicated prompts. However, use [de-emphasis] if it's too much (especially on simple prompts).</p><p><strong>keyword: "bodygrammps"</strong></p><p>If it completely overshoots. Try putting things like "veiny" in the negative. Had to use a low part of that for wrinkles, but can take over very occasionally. </p><p>Same goes with "grey hair, gray hair" if you don't want that, as it will often default to it.</p><p>It seems pretty neutral on what you use, but works best the better at anatomy the model is, originally tested it with HassanBlend. All example images are done with URPM 1.1 (1A830BB8).</p>
