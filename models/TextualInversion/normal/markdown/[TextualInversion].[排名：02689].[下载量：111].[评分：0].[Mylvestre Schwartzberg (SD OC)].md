### 三、详情
<p>Mylvestre was born to Austrian and Italian immigrants in the Bronx NYC, and found early fame as a body-builder and performer in a boy-band with his brothers, before changing careers and becoming <strong>the </strong>definitive 80's action-movie star. Now he's ready to feature in your SD creations. As a minor side-note ... Mylvestre doesn't exist, and is an AI OC, a character not based on any living person, in personality or looks. Mylvestre may LOOK like somebody you know, but he's a Nobody.<br /><br />He's happy to be your action hero lead, your ruthless bad guy, or your fitspo meme illustration, when you need a consistent character not based on any one living person. He works in every model I've tested (which is quite a few), and does <em>seem</em> to prefer taking his shirt off despite most of my training images keeping the shirt ON (go figure, huh ?). Long hair also seems to be a 'thing', so if you don't want that I suggest an appropriate negative prompt.</p><p></p><p>Inspired by <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/Zovya">Zovya's</a> <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/tag/nobody">Nobody</a> series.
