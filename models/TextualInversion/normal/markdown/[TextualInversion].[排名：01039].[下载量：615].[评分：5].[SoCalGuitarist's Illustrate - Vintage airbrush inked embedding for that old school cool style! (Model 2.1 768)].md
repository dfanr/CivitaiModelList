<p>You know that really cool inked and airbrushed style that seemed to dominate advertising, book covers and movie posters in the early to mid 80's? Think Heavy Metal (both the genre and the movie), Duran Duran music videos, Nintendo box art, Atari magazine spreads and sexy robot women with lasers for eyes and metallic cones for... Well, you know.</p><p></p><p>I've been trying to capture that old-school-cool style in an embedding, and I think I've come up with a pretty good one here!<strong> Illustrate</strong> is my attempt to bottle that style and make it easily available for the Stable Diffusion community. As with all of my other <strong>high quality </strong>embeddings, this embed is versatile and flexible. It is inpaint and latent upscale friendly (see sample images for examples), and easily mixes with other embeds. All of the sample images on this page use my <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/2385/socalguitarists-magic-facelift-negative-embedding-for-model-2x-fix-yo-ugly-faces">Fix yo' ugly face! magic facelift embedding</a> as well as a smattering of my other embeds. Check <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/SoCalGuitarist">my profile</a> to find and download my other <strong>high quality</strong> embeddings, and be sure to follow me to be notified when I release new content!</p><p></p><p>💖💖I hope you enjoy using these embeddings in your art as much as I enjoy creating them for the Stable Diffusion community. 🙏🏼🙏🏼If you do like them, can you pretty please <u>click the heart</u> at the top and leave a review? Many thanks! 💖💖</p><p></p><p><strong>Illustrate</strong> delivers hand inked, airbrushed style that can be applied across a multitude of subjects, locations and objects. It was trained on and favors a vintage style that was popularized in the early 80's. The embed favors simple single color backgrounds, but can be prompted to add detail into scenes easily. One oddity of this embed is that it likes to put high heels on men, fair warning - Neg "high heels" if you don't want them to show up, and if they do anyway, well, that's what inpainting is for! Did I mention it also inpaints incredibly well using just the 2.1 model? No need to switch models for inpainting!</p><p></p><p>--------</p><p><strong>To use this embedding in AUTOMATIC1111, copy it to your embeddings folder in your stable-diffusion-webui directory. No need to restart, just invoke the embedding from your prompt. Make sure you are using a compatible model or you will get errors!</strong></p><p>--------</p><p></p>
