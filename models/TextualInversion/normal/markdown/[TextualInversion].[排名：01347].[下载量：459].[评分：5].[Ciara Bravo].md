<p><strong>Ciara Bravo, actress (if you’ve never seen the show ‘Wayne’, I highly suggest it.)<br />Description and prompt below!</strong><br /><br /><strong>PLEASE LEAVE A REVIEW! I'm still tweaking my process and it helps seeing how my TI's turn out in other people's results.<br /><br /></strong>Using my own model in the examples here, still fine-tuning it a touch but will be releasing that later this week!<br />Also, I’m a HUGE FAN of Leosam's FilmGirl lora, although sometimes it fights my TI’s (believe it’s heavily trained on an asian dataset), it does a phenomenal job at adding a realistic film look. Check it out if you haven’t!<strong><br /></strong><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/33208/filmgirl-film-grain-lora￼￼Lower"><strong>https://civitai.com/models/33208/filmgirl-film-grain-lora</strong><br /><br /><strong>Lower</strong></a><strong> CFG gives best results, I hang out around 4.5.<br /><br />I gotta mention that Ciara in real life looks much younger than she is, so the TI tends to lean that direction. Takes a decent amount of prompting to get away from that.</strong><br /><br /><strong>TIP - DON'T USE MANY (if any) DESCRIPTIVE WORDS ABOUT THE SUBJECT IN YOUR PROMPT WHEN USING A SUBJECT BASED TI.</strong><br />Textual Inversions are trained on the appearance of the subject, therefore every time you add a descriptive element (hair color, body type, etc) to your prompt, you are fighting the embedding and results will be less accurate. Stuff like hairstyles (hair in a ponytail) usually will not fight an embedding and <em>can</em> help if they describe actual traits in the embedding, but if they aren't true to the character it will only fight it. And too many of them definitely will fight it.<br /><br />When using textual inversions for people/characters, use a formula like:<br />&lt;embedding&gt; + scene + pose/outfit + environment/lighting/quality triggers<br /><br />Lower CFG also gives more strength to the embedding vs your overall prompt. I’ve found a lower CFG works better for<strong> any embedding on this site</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>TEST PROMPT</strong><br />(I use a system the uses &lt;&gt; for TI triggers, remove those if your UI doesn't utilize that.)</p><p></p><p>&lt;fenn_ciara&gt;, fashion photography portrait of a pretty woman, sitting, (sweaty), mature body, flirty, 26 years old, in a lush rainforest, large exotic flowers, smiling, offshoulder, fluffy short hair in a (high ponytail), soft light, rim light, beautiful shadow, low key, (photorealistic, raw photo:1.2), (natural skin texture, realistic eye and face details), hyperrealism, ultra high res, 4K, Best quality, masterpiece, necklace, cleavage, in the dark<br /><br />Negative -<br />Nude, nsfw, unclad, (Child, childlike), hat, headwear, cartoon, anime, sketches, (worst quality:1.5), (low quality:1,.5), lowres, ((monochrome)), (deformed, distorted, disfigured:1.3), poorly drawn,large hands, bad anatomy, wrong anatomy, extra limb, missing limb, floating limbs, (mutated hands and fingers:1.4), disconnected limbs, mutation, mutated, ugly, disgusting, blurry, amputation, &lt;bad_prompt&gt;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Trained at 1000 steps on 20 images.
