<p><strong>Spidey512 </strong>is your friendly neighborhood superhero packaged up into a neat little embed for your creative pleasure.  I have designed it to be as flexible and coherent as possible, delivering easy, reliable results. While <strong>Spidey512 </strong>will naturally gravitate towards creating male characters, there is nothing inherently male in the embed itself, and it seems to respond pretty well to "Spider Gwen" and hah, even "Spider Pig" suggestions.</p><p></p><p>As with all of my other <strong>high quality</strong> embeds, I have tried to make this embedding as simple to use as possible. <strong>Spidey512</strong> works best with short, simple prompts, no need to add styles or artists to make it work. That said, it should be very responsive to your prompt, and the more direction you give it, the more creative your results will be! <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/socalguitarist">Follow me here on Civit to be notified when I drop new releases.</a> </p><p></p><p>I have tested <strong>Spidey512</strong> embedding on multiple 1.5 models, and so far it's worked on all of them with excellent results. While you can use it on the base 1.5 model, please don't, it's friggen awful and you will be disappointed. I highly recommend <a rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/4384/dreamshaper">Dreamshaper</a>, it has beautiful, coherent quality output that continues to amaze me, without all of the goofy face issues and token dropping problems that seem to plague the protogen mixes. It also responds really well to the anime models, and seems to play along with Danbooru just fine, though admittedly I didn't test that capability much.</p><p></p><p><strong>NOTE - </strong>Some of the sample images are using embeddings that I have not yet released, as they are still in testing. You should still be able to get fairly close approximations using the same models without my embeddings, and keep an eye on my profile for when I do get them out the door!</p><p></p><p>--------</p><p><strong>To use this embedding in AUTOMATIC1111, copy it to your embeddings folder in your stable-diffusion-webui directory. No need to restart, just invoke the embedding from your prompt. Make sure you are using a compatible model or you will get errors!</strong></p><p>--------</p>
