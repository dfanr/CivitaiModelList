<p>This TI attempts to capture the likeness of "<strong>The Redheaded Libertarian</strong>" on Twitter. TRHL is an artist, model, and political commentator recognized for her intelligence, sharp wit, eponymous red hair, pronounced cheekbones, green eyes (central heterochromia) and seemingly age-defying youthful appearance.</p><p>Used with the SD1.5 base model, it will create a reasonable likeness of the source.  Used with any other model, it will add "TRHL" features, typically pronounced cheekbones and a demure look.</p><p>The TI was using A1111 with 3400 steps.</p><p><em>Please note! Only the base SD1.5 model seems to capture the likeness. If you're using a different model, you may want to inpaint using the base SD1.5 model if reproducing the general likeness is important.</em></p><p>For whatever reason, using the base SD1.5 model, this TI wants to make the persona older by adding excessive crow's feet around the eyes. You'll need to negative prompt wrinkles, old, elderly, etc. to get the image closer to real life. If using another model (e.g. Deliberate) you can remove these negative prompts, as the TI will typically produce a younger female.  </p><p>Please note, <strong>most of these images have had some level of inpainting or face restoration</strong>. The base prompts will get you 90% of the way there, but you'll need to work a bit to get better hair, add freckles, etc.  </p><p>The initial images are a combination of SD1.5 base for the likeness with Deliberate for the details.  The last few images were rendered with different models, and you can see what a huge difference that produces in the output.  The models used are noted in the prompt details.</p><p><strong>Prompts are formatted for Invoke. If you're using A1111, you'll need to modify accordingly.</strong></p>
