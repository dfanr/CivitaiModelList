<h2>What can I create with this?</h2><p>Whatever you want, but here are a few ideas:</p><ol><li><p>Video games concept art (as a reference for the art team)</p></li><li><p>HQ fantasy landscapes wallpapers</p></li><li><p>Add backgrounds to your characters by adding "<em>background in the style of hoppagames" </em>(experimental)</p></li></ol><h2>Complete workflow</h2><p>Recommended to have <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://github.com/some9000/StylePile">StylePile</a> extension installed and a <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGTP</a> account.</p><h3>Positive prompt structure</h3><p>style of (hoppagames:1.0), (Award-winning photograph), <strong>{your subject tags}, {style tags}</strong></p><p><strong>Example positive prompt</strong></p><p>Replace bold text with your subject descriptors:</p><p><em>style of (hoppagames:1.0), (Award-winning photograph), </em><strong><em>(Japanese garden), (Autumn foliage), (Vibrant colors), (Fallen leaves), (Nature's beauty), (Red and gold hues), (Maple trees), (Reflections on water), (Peaceful tranquility), (Traditional wooden architecture), (Rustic bridges), (Soothing natural sounds), (Seasonal delight), (Serene garden views)</em></strong><em>, (Low-angle perspective), (natural lighting), (Wide-angle lens capturing scenery), hidden objects games, video game concept art, (8K Unity wallpaper), fine details, award-winning image, highly detailed, 16k, cinematic perspective, ((video game environment concept art style)), pretty colors, cinematic environment</em></p><h3>Negative prompt structure</h3><p>I use <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/4629/deep-negative-v1x">Deep Negative</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/8551/scg-embedding-toolkit-for-version-15-models-a-collection-of-tools-and-helpers-from-my-personal-kit">Negative Facelift</a>, plus I add negative tags from the model I am using (take from landscape not people in examples or comments)</p><p><strong>Example negative prompt</strong></p><p>neg_facelift512, ng_deepnegative_v1_75t, watermark, signature, worst quality, low quality, medium quality, deleted, lowres, comic, (watermarks), watermark, signature</p><h3>Settings</h3><p>I used 960x640 px canvas size, without a hi-res fix to generate examples, but feel free to start with a smaller size canvas (768x512) and apply a hi-res fix <em>OR</em> send it to IMG2IMG and upscale with the same prompt and denoising of 0.2-0.5.</p><p>CFG scale and steps you can copy from your model examples but should work well on most of the models with CFG of 7-9 and 50-70 steps.</p><p>The style is very strong at 1:0 strength so choose a model that is well-responsive to prompting rather than chosen for visual style because it will be overwritten by the style. I found <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/4823/deliberate">Deliberate</a> to be a well-behaving model for the purpose, but others worked ok as well.</p><p></p><h2>Unique Subject generation workflow</h2><p></p><h3>Step 1: ChatGTP</h3><p>Go to ChatGTP, copy this command, and replace the bold text with your own scene idea and the number of variations you want. I use 3, which should be enough to get you a subject you will like.</p><p><em>describe an award-winning photograph of a </em><strong><em>wedding shop interior</em></strong><em> in a maximum of 15 phrases 1-3 words long, put them in brackets and separate brackets by commas in one line. Talk about all the objects in the scene. Use this example for the structure but ignore values: A cozy living room with (Plush comfortable sofa), (fireplace), (Soft fluffy throw pillows), (Warm, cozy blankets), (Rustic, wooden coffee table), (Plush fluffy rug), (Comfy, oversized armchair), (elegant and framed portrait photos on the wall), (Vintage patterned curtains), (Bookshelf with family photo albums and books), (Accent lighting for artwork and photos), (Artisanal and handcrafted pottery and ceramics), (earthy natural wood decor), (a vase with fresh flowers), (wooden side table with a reading lamp). Give me </em><strong><em>3</em></strong><em> different ideas</em></p><h3>Step 2: Feed StylePile</h3><p>In your positive prompt, replace subject tags with [X] and copy-paste results from ChatGTP into [X] variables field in StylePile part. Remove the "." at the end of each idea because you have "[X]," in your prompt and you don't want it to become "[subject.],"</p><p><strong>The positive prompt is now:</strong></p><p><em>style of (hoppagames:1.0), </em><strong><em>[X]</em></strong><em>, (Low-angle perspective), (natural lighting), (Wide-angle lens capturing scenery), hidden objects games, video game concept art, (8K Unity wallpaper), fine details, award-winning image, highly detailed, 16k, cinematic perspective, ((video game environment concept art style)), pretty colors, cinematic environment</em></p><p><strong>The StylePile's X variables field is now:</strong></p><p><em>(Award-winning photograph), (Japanese garden), (Peaceful pond), (Serene rock formations), (Colorful koi fish), (Zen garden), (Ornamental trees), (Moss-covered stones), (Delicate flowers), (Traditional lanterns), (Stone pathways), (Cherry blossom trees), (Bamboo fences), (Red bridges), (Tranquil ambiance)</em></p><p><em>(Award-winning photograph), (Japanese garden), (Lush greenery), (Pristine landscaping), (Water features), (Stone statues), (Symmetrical design), (Manicured trees), (Perfectly trimmed shrubs), (Sculpted bushes), (Garden art), (Traditional architecture), (Tea house), (Bonsai trees), (Impeccable precision)</em></p><p><em>(Award-winning photograph), (Japanese garden), (Autumn foliage), (Vibrant colors), (Fallen leaves), (Nature's beauty), (Red and gold hues), (Maple trees), (Reflections on water), (Peaceful tranquility), (Traditional wooden architecture), (Rustic bridges), (Soothing natural sounds), (Seasonal delight), (Serene garden views)</em></p><h3>Step 3 - Generate, Pick &amp; Upscale</h3><p>Setting batch to 1 will produce 3 images if you have 3 subjects in StylePile. You can do 2 batches, so a total of 6 small images should be enough to pick a winner.</p><p>Your winner goes to IMG2IMG and upscales to your desired size with 0.2 denoising.</p><p></p><p>Enjoy and please share your best results in the comments!</p><p></p>
