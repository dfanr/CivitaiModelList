<p>This is my first vehicle embedding, so it's a bit of a work in progress, but I'm having fun with it. I think to get a driver I'd need to actually train it with people driving it, which I may do if I can source images with drivers.</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: So as @maliceinrend <a rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/reviews/127660">points out in his review</a>, this TI isn't very good at exactly replicating the Hornet's looks, especially the grille. I'm not exactly sure why, but it may be just be a limitation of using a textual inversion as opposed to a LoRA. I'll keep exploring!</p><p>In the meantime it does create cool looking early 1950s cars that have the DNA of a Hornet. </p><h3 id="heading-18">About the Hudson Hornet</h3><p>The Hudson Hornet is a full-sized automobile that was manufactured by Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan from 1951 until 1954, when Nash-Kelvinator and Hudson merged to form American Motors Corporation (AMC). Hudson automobiles continued to be marketed under the Hudson brand name through the 1957 model year.</p><p>The first-generation Hudson Hornets featured a functional "step-down" design with dropped floorpan and a chassis with a lower center of gravity than contemporary vehicles that helped the car handle well — an advantage for racing.[1] The Hornet's lower and sleeker look was accentuated by streamlined styling, sometimes called "ponton" styling.</p><p>Following the merger forming AMC in 1954, Hudson cars were built on the newer factory assembly line for Nash Statesman/Ambassador unibody chassis; therefore, all second-generation Hudson Hornets were restyled Nash automobiles that were badge engineered as a Hudson.
