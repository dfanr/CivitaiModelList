### 三、详情
<p><strong>Jessica Chobot</strong> is a gamer and television personality.  She got her start in the industry hosting gaming programming for IGN and Microsoft covering video games as well as attending many industry events.  She currently can be seen on various programs on the discovery network of shows, including a show called Expedition X.  <br /><br />Aside from all that, it should be obvious that she's a very attractive lady.  She looks just as good now as she always has, but I did choose the dataset based on much of the time earlier in her career (mostly only noticeable if you pay attention to the hairstyle).<br /></p><p><em>There's probably going to be exactly 1, maybe 2 other people that understand the reference, but for diehard Chobot fans, I gave it a shot at recreating </em><strong><em>the</em></strong><em> picture.  You know, the one that basically kicked off her entire career in the industry.</em><br /></p><p>Tested with a good number of models with decent results.  Mostly realistic style models.  Not too many anime models, but a couple artistic oreinted ones though such as Dreamscaper, Galaxy Time Machine, and DucHaiten's models.<br /></p><p>Trained up to 6000 steps on the base 1.5 model so it should work with most 1.5 models.<br /></p><p>Some of the prompts in my images might have a different name than the actual filename, they were images I liked when I was running XYZ plot tests that I liked the result, all images have the same training strength as the 1.0 version of this TI.<br /></p><p>I have made a decent number of Textual Inversions for personal use for projects, but not many that I have actually released to the public, so hopefully this is up to the mark for people's standards.  <br /><br />Huge shoutout to <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/JernauGurgeh"><strong>JernauGurgeh</strong></a> for being such a good soul and being not only helpful, but enthusiastic and a great member of the community.  You should check out their work, they're one of the people I respect and look to most as a member of the community when it comes to creating good TIs and sharing good info.</p>
