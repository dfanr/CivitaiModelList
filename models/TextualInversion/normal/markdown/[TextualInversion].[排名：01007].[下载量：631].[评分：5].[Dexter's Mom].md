<p><strong>Even with VAE, my results look desaturated to me on some models. I really want to move onto another character. I might come back and fix it.</strong></p><p>I put a lot of work into this one. I'm not sure if it paid off or not. You tell me. Trained using screenshots from the show as the initial dataset and added images I generated in subsequent trainings. I had a rough time getting it to work. I like how the eyes turned out!</p><p></p><p><strong>I trained her with the rubber gloves, but they don't come across very well. Adding "wearing gloves" might help. Saying "Yellow Gloves" makes a lot more things yellow.</strong></p><p>She tends to have one of those maid hats or a hair band thing for some reason. She also tends to have some kind of shirt on. Play with the prompting, there might be a solution for it. I am an idiot when it comes to prompts.</p><p></p><p>I couldn't get her usual outfit to train exactly. Sometimes it works, but it's like 1/20 chances. <strong>If anyone is able to hone in on a good, fairly consistent prompt, I'd like to see some examples.</strong></p>
