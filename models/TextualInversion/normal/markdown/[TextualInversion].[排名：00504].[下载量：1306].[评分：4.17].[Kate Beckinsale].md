<p>Appreciate my work? Can you <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tangokiss">buy me a coffe</a> please :)</p><p></p><p><a rel="ugc" href="https://www.instagram.com/katebeckinsale/">Kate Beckinsale: </a>Kathrin Romany Beckinsale 2​3​ was born in Chiswick, London, England. She is the only child of actor Richard Beckinsale and actress Judy Loe.4 Her father was of Burmese descent.5 She made her first television appearance at the age of four, in an episode of This is Your Life dedicated to her father.5 When he was five years old, his 31-year-old father died suddenly of a heart attack. Beckinsale was deeply traumatized by the loss and "began to expect bad things to happen". While she has seen her father "more on television than in life", "there are certainly enough memories, not to feel like it's someone I didn't know." 4 His widowed mother moved to live with director Roy Battersby when Beckinsale was nine years old and he grew up with their four sons and daughter. 7 He has a close relationship with his stepfather: "there could not be a better point ...he wasn't aggressive, so he let me come to him." Beckinsale has a paternal half-sister, actress Samantha Beckinsale, but they have not had regular contact.</p><p></p><p>Used model: Realistic Vision v1,3</p><p>recommended parameters:</p><p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p><p>RAW photo, a close up portrait photo of 26 y.o woman in wastelander clothes, long haircut, pale skin, slim body, background is city ruins, (high detailed skin:1.2), 8k uhd, dslr, soft lighting, high quality, film grain, Fujifilm XT3</p><p></p><p><strong>Negative Prompt:</strong><br />(deformed iris, deformed pupils, semi-realistic, cgi, 3d, render, sketch, cartoon, drawing, anime:1.4), text, close up, cropped, out of frame, worst quality, low quality, jpeg artifacts, ugly, duplicate, morbid, mutilated, extra fingers, mutated hands, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn face, mutation, deformed, blurry, dehydrated, bad anatomy, bad proportions, extra limbs, cloned face, disfigured, gross proportions, malformed limbs, missing arms, missing legs, extra arms, extra legs, fused fingers, too many fingers, long neck</p><p><br /><strong>DPM++ 2S a Karras with 25 steps<br />CFG Scale 7</strong></p><p></p><p>QR to my page buymeacoffee </p><p></p><img src="https://imagecache.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/4c1749c1-fbf1-4f96-8117-cf4fdf5bfc00/width=525/4c1749c1-fbf1-4f96-8117-cf4fdf5bfc00" /><p>Hide</p>
