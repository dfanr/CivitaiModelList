<p>Probably going to Hell for this.<br /><br />Introducing, the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.<br />Just in time for him to come back to life in all of your wildest AI generation fantasies, and bring you fancy eggs filled with goodies.<br /><br />Trained on all of the classic images you've seen around over the years of the ol' guy, (but let's be honest, probably not accurate to what he actually looked like if real.)<br />Hell, the Bible doesn't even really talk about what he looked like aside from the fact that he was probably ugly. <br /><strong><em>This embedding however, generates the total smoke show you've all come to love.</em></strong><br /><br /><strong>I WOULD LOVE TO SEE WHAT YOU MAKE, I PRAY THAT YOU ALL WILL THROW SOME RESULTS UP HERE.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Happy Easter ya'll.</strong><br /><br /><strong><u>Lower CFG gives best results, I hang out around 4.5.</u></strong><br /><br /><strong>TIP - DON'T USE MANY (if any) DESCRIPTIVE WORDS ABOUT THE SUBJECT IN YOUR PROMPT WHEN USING A SUBJECT BASED TI.</strong><br />Textual Inversions are trained on the appearance of the subject, therefore every time you add a descriptive element (hair color, body type, etc) to your prompt, you are fighting the embedding and results will be less accurate. Stuff like hairstyles (hair in a ponytail) usually will not fight an embedding and <em>can</em> help if they describe actual traits in the embedding, but if they aren't true to the character it will only fight it. And too many of them definitely will fight it.<br /><br />When using textual inversions for people/characters, use a formula like:<br />&lt;embedding&gt; + scene + pose/outfit + environment/lighting/quality triggers<br /><br />Lower CFG also gives more strength to the embedding vs your overall prompt. I’ve found a lower CFG works better for<strong> <u>any embedding on this site</u></strong>.<br /><br /><strong><u>TEST PROMPT</u></strong><br />(I use a system the uses &lt;&gt; for TI triggers, remove those if your UI doesn't utilize that.)<br /><br />&lt;fenn_jesus&gt;, hyper realistic photograph, portrait of a man, holy, mythological, mythology, highly detailed, photorealism, best quality, 4k, (solar eclipse, outside, dark sky), cinematic lighting, (looking at viewer), shot on Canon, detailed skin, sharp focus, rim lighting, two tone lighting, dimly lit, low key<br /><br />far away, ugly, low-res, blurry, short hair, bad anatomy, anime, cartoon, 3d render, illustration, disfigured, poorly drawn face, (text, watermark, signature), mutation, mutated, extra limb, ugly, poorly drawn hands, missing limb, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, malformed hands, out of focus, long neck, long body, disgusting, poorly drawn, mutilated, mangled, old, surreal, far away shot, monochrome,</p>
