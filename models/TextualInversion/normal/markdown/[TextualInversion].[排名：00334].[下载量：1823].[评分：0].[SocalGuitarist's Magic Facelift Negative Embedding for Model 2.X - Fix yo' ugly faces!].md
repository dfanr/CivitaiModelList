<h3><em>"This is excellent. I was very displeased with my Dreambooth results on 2.1. I tried some of the positive embeddings which helped, but this is </em><strong><em>amazing</em></strong><em>. Like night and day. Thank you!" - PiyarSquare, </em><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://reddit.com/r/sdforall/comments/zuf8ul/_/j1kgigl/?context=1"><em>Reddit</em></a></h3><p></p><p>Have you guys noticed something... odd about the faces in 2.X? Proportions seem a bit off, tiny eyes mashed close together, faces seem stretched and contorted, smiles just look.... bad? I like to call that 2.0 ugh face, and it's a very common problem in 2.0 for some reason. Well, never fear, through a lot of testing, I've come up with a negative embedding that fixes those goofy WTF faces! Just add my new <strong>high quality</strong> facelift embedding to your negative prompt and wipe those goofy grins away!</p><p><strong>Warning - This is a <u>Negative</u> <u>Embedding</u> and is designed to be used in the negative prompt. you're gonna get some seriously wacky results if you use this in your regular prompt!</strong></p><p>I am using my <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/2382/socalguitarist-analog-film-photographic-scene-enhancement-for-model-2021-modern-old-school-classic-bandw-vintage">AnalogFilm768 embedding</a> for the samples on this page. As with all of my <strong>high quality</strong> embeddings, this Facelift embedding is highly versatile and flexible, allowing you to craft the scenes you want with little alteration from my embeddings. <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/SoCalGuitarist">Check my profile to see all of my other <strong>high quality </strong>embeddings</a>, and follow me if you want to be notified when I release new content.</p><p>💖💖I hope you enjoy using these embeddings in your art as much as I enjoy creating them for the Stable Diffusion community. 🙏🏼🙏🏼If you do like them, can you pretty please <u>click the heart</u> at the top and leave a review? Many thanks! 💖💖</p><p></p><p><strong><u>Versions</u></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Neg_Facelift768 </strong>- Invoke this embedding from your negative prompt, watch the magic happen. It fixes faces and makes them look more realistic. That's it. It can't fix an already ugly picture, but it sure can turn those SD2.0 clown frowns up-side-down!</p><p></p><p>---------</p><p><strong>A note on the creation of this embedding</strong></p><p>This embedding was created through targeted prompt crafting, tokenization and careful merging. No training involved! Because of this method of creation, It is highly versatile and flexible, and should work in a multitude of situations and scenarios. Due to the nature of how its created, it is on the larger side at 19 vectors. This shouldn't cause any problems in AUTO1111 UI, however it may slow down your It/s a bit.</p><p>--------</p><p><strong>To use these embeddings in AUTOMATIC1111, copy them to your embeddings folder in your stable-diffusion-webui directory. No need to restart, just invoke the embedding from your <u>NEGATIVE</u> prompt. Make sure you are using a compatible model or you will get errors!</strong></p><p>--------</p><p></p><p></p>
