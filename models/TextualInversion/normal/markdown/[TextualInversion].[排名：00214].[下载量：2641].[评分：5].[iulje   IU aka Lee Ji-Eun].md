### 三、详情
<p>This textual inversion file is my first test of this technique. The result seems to me quite convincing but I will understand that it is not up to the fans of this wonderful Korean actress. Sorry! But the face is still pretty and consistent, so usable. I attach some images rendered with different models and it works overall well all the time. I hope to see some prompts with it. Thanks to downloaders :)<br /><br />This IU aka Lee Ji-Eun embed was trained in SD 1.5, for 3000 Steps using Textual Inversion at a learning rate of  0.5:50,0.05:100,0.005:200,0.001:1000,0.0005:1000,0.0001:2000,0.00005<br />The Dataset contains 90 images. Embed is 3 vector.</p><p>Type the name of the embed in prompt to use in your gens, its "iulje" by default but you can rename it to whatever you please.</p><p></p><p></p>
