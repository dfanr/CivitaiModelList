### 三、详情
<p>Starting out acting on the teen drama "The V.A.E", Bilphanie got her big break starring in the music video for the Gans 'N Posers song "Movember Pain", where she also met her husband <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/43985/gavid-paltrose-sd-oc">Gavid Paltrose</a>. A modelling career soon followed, and she became bigger than Cindy &amp; Kate combined. After deciding to divorce Gavid, she declared "anyone can do music", and put her money where her mouth was by quitting modelling and forming an all-girl punk band. The subsequent music video for their diss-track "Horsey", featuring a Gavid-lookalike fellating a stallion, cemented her band's reputation as the most dangerous women working in punk-rock.</p><p><br />As a minor side-note ... Bilphanie doesn't exist, and is an AI OC, a character not based on any living person, in personality or looks. Bilphanie may LOOK like somebody you know, but she's a Nobody.</p><p><br />She's happy to be your punk-rock heroine, your successful fashion model, or your (cute) girl next door, when you need a consistent character not based on any one living person. She works in every model I've tested (which is quite a few), likes to keep her hair long, and has been created using a different workflow to my previous two TIs, so should be even more flexible than they are.<br /></p><p>Inspired by <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/Zovya/models">Zovya's</a> <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/tag/nobody">Nobody</a> series.
