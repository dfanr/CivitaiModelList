### 三、详情
<h1>Hunter69 v1</h1><h3><em>release date: 17 January 2023</em></h3><p><strong>Due to many DM requests on Discord</strong>, I decided to share version 1 of my model which is a merge of some popular models (<em>forgot which ones</em>) and 3 private ones (<em>not from Civitai or any other public website - <u>but with permission</u></em>), which I have perfectionized into the ideal checkpoint/model for creating stunning real life looking female nude models.<br /><br />Despite the possibility of being able to create cartoons/anime/drawings/males/objects, <strong>I have focussed a lot towards generating female (solo) nude art models similar to the style of that from MetArt &amp; Domai.</strong><br /><br />I'm currently am working on v3, which is already a huge improvement over v1 after v2 became corrupted (in the sense of missing a few amount of bytes during transfer from server to server) and therefore being unable to load it.</p><p></p><p><strong>When will v3 be released?</strong><br />Most-likely around April 2022 or earlier, as I want to merge it with more embeddings as well as merge it with a yet to be privately released model trained completely by myself.<br />There won't be new versions of this particular model on Civitai, Hunter v3 will most-likely be released with a different name and of course on Civitai!<br /><br /><strong>Updates</strong><br />If you like to stay up to date by seeing many images that I've made using (for now using codename) Hunter69 v3, then please follow me on <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.patreon.com/hunter69"><strong>Patreon</strong></a> where I will also share some of the <em>prompts</em> I have used which are not that far of from v1.<br /><br /><strong>Merges</strong><br />I support creativity, if you plan to use this model for merges, you do not have to credit me, that's up to you. But thanks in advance for doing so.<br /><br /><strong>Support my efforts</strong><br />Want to support my efforts, which take a lot of time, testing, plotting, comparing, rendering, you can subscribe to my <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.patreon.com/hunter69"><strong>Patreon</strong></a> for as many months as you like or simply <a rel="ugc" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/iamhunter69"><strong>buy me a coffee</strong></a> and help me reach my goal.<br /><br />You will not only help support me with a brand new videocard I'm saving for, which will make training of my new future models from scratch (no merging) much faster, but you'll also get access to HQ (1024/1280/1368px) images I have created myself and more!<br /></p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><ul><li><p>This model requires vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned</p></li><li><p>Despite me using my model mostly for 21-30 year old Asians females, it does work for any ethnicity and/or age as shown in the gallery of X/Y plotting</p></li><li><p>Not enough Examples?
