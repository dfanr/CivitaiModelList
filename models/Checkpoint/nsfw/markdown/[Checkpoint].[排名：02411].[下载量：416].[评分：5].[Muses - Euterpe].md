<p>This checkpoint merge was intended to be a rework of <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/79077">Erato</a>, but it became it's own thing. It is a male focused model. <u>It can make women but you will most likely end up with a futanari </u>unless there are clothes involved, and even then you might get a penis.  All samples posted by me are direct generations in txt2img, no inpainting.</p><h2 id="terpsicore">Euterpe</h2><h3 id="muse-of-dance-and-mother-to-the-sirens">Muse of flutes and music</h3><p>As the muse of flutes, this merge makes flaccid penises pretty consistently, even if you don't ask for them. By default it wants to make men naked, muscular, and 20 to 30 something.</p><ul><li><p>You do not need heavy prompting to get decent results, for best results:</p><ul><li><p>Use Sampling steps between 25 and 40</p></li><li><p>Use CFG between 3 and 7</p></li><li><p>Sampling method DPM++ 2M SDE Karras works well, but feel free to experiment</p></li><li><p>Go light on the negatives, textural inversions like easynegative, and bad_prompt tend to change things a lot. ng_deepnegative verybadimagenegative and JuggernautNegative seem to work better</p></li></ul></li><li><p>If you want clothes on, make sure to mention them or they will likely not appear. this applies to shirts, pants, shoes, socks, etc.</p></li><li><p>Use the word "penis" in the prompt to get a better shaped penis. Without it you may get a deformed one, sometimes it will just look like it's uncut.</p></li><li><p>The model favors flaccid penises, use LoRA or the word "erect" with higher weights and you might get lucky. Still trying to find the right combination of words to make them go up, but frenulum and glans seem to have an effect.</p></li><li><p>To get a man older than a 30-something, use the word "mature" and the target age. using clip skip 2 or a different sample might also help.</p></li><li><p>Although it doesn't always need it, using ADetailer for faces might give you better results.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2 id="heading-3624">My other mixes:</h2><h3 id="heading-3625"><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/79077">Erato: </a>The muse of lyric erotic poetry</h3><p>Erato will generate men and consistent penises most of the time, the ones from Euterpe are better shaped, but they tend to be flaccid, where Erato tends to make them erect more consistently.</p><h3 id="heading-3626"><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/86320">Terpsicore: </a>Muse of dance and mother to the sirens</h3><p>Use it to make Furry characters and hairier men.</p><p></p><h2 id="the-mix-ins">The Mix-ins</h2><p>Euterpe it's it own thing and was born out of the desire to remake Erato from scratch to free up the licensing. It is a product of over 20 different weighted merges. To get it just to the right place.</p>
