<p>PLEASE READ DESCRIPTION</p><p><strong>*update*: I do love REA, but I consider it to be an outdated version of this new baby</strong>: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/3950/art-and-eros-aeros-a-tribute-to-beauty">https://civitai.com/models/3950/art-and-eros-aeros-a-tribute-to-beauty</a></p><p>As such, it will have no new development. I will keep it here should anybody have a need for it.</p><p></p><p>Patreon at the beginning, yay!: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=84473395">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=84473395</a></p><p>Check any info or questions at our private Discord here: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://discord.gg/z88HpDwbGq">https://discord.gg/z88HpDwbGq</a></p><p><strong>it needs vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned (or another one if you want to get experimental) or it will output broken images.</strong></p><p>Hello everybody!! I proudly present you my merged NSFW model I have been working for weeks to try and get the most emergent properties within the models contained. SD 1.5 is the base most of the models contained used, with exceptions. The name is a meme and it references all that is inside of it.</p><p>So let me thank everybody who made it possible, because I if there's anything good on it is because the source material was great too. So my thanks in no particular order to <em>Hassan</em>, <em>AloeVera</em>, the <em>CivitAI Team</em>, <em>Izuek</em>, <em>Someone88</em>, <em>wavymulder</em>, <em>UnstableDiffusion Team</em> and any other creator I might not have been able to cite.</p><p><u>ABOUT:</u></p><p>First it may not be the best begginer checkpoint out there. I consider myself experienced at prompting so I haven't tried much basic prompts, however I doubt that a plain "pretty naked woman, big boobs" is going to take you very far with it. However, although I prompt a bit different than that I have tested that <strong>it understands the words from the language of PhotoReal v0.5</strong> (it is contained within the merge), so if you are having troubles getting good outputs from it you can begin from there, but in general, try to use a more natural language than an array of commas: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-DDIHVbsYfynTp_rsKLu4b2tSQgxtO5F6pNsNla12k0/edit</p><p>There's also one screenshot with a very basic example prompt for you to get the idea.</p><p>According to my testing it is a very powerful model for it's porpouse, but it is a project I made for myself which means that depending on what you want it may or may not lack certain areas. It has been intensively tested to <strong>generate photorealistic(ish) images of different types of girls in different poses in different places wearing different things with different artistic moods</strong>. Nothing more, nothing less. From hardcore, to to group, to drawing, are out of the scope uses that may or may not work.</p><p><u>HOW TO USE IT:</u></p><ul><li><p>You <strong>MUST USE vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned</strong> (or experimentally other VAEs). Otherwise it breaks.</p></li><li><p>Some users report having problems using something different than Automatic1111webui. Cannot troubleshoot that myself.</p></li><li><p>This model <strong>DOES <u>NOT</u> REQUIRE TO USE TRIGGER WORDS</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Works for a wide variety of steps from 20 to 130 tested. I use 128.</p></li><li><p>It works on it's own at making general or NSFW images of ladies of high quality.</p></li><li><p>Resolutions tested are <em>512x512, 384x704, 512x768</em> and <em>768x768</em> (the latest is a bit more buggy but decent enough)</p></li><li><p>Trigger words are general <strong>style modifiers</strong>. They can be used alone or in combination and will give an special mood to the composition.</p></li><li><p>Trigger words have only been tested using them <strong>at the beggining</strong> of the prompt.</p></li><li><p>If used together in any subset combination they work better if they appear in this relative order: "<em>elden ring style postapocalypse knollingcase analog style b</em>f" or "<em>postapocalypse elden ring style knollingcase analog style bf</em>".</p></li></ul><p><u>MERGED:</u></p><p>I haven't kept track of all the steps done in the merge (I used a weird methodology), but this is what's inside in different proportions:</p><ul><li><p>PhotoReal v0.5: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-DDIHVbsYfynTp_rsKLu4b2tSQgxtO5F6pNsNla12k0/edit</p></li><li><p>Elden Ring Style: https://civitai.com/models/5/elden-ring-style</p></li><li><p>Postapocalypse: https://civitai.com/models/1136/postapocalypse</p></li><li><p>Analog Diffusion: https://civitai.com/models/1265/analog-diffusion</p></li><li><p>SXD: https://civitai.com/models/1169/sxd</p></li><li><p>Knollingcase: https://civitai.com/models/1092/knollingcase</p></li><li><p>Hassan's 1.4 and CandyBerry: https://civitai.com/models/1173/hassanblend-all-versions</p></li><li><p>PurePornPlus: https://civitai.com/models/1235/purepornplus-merge</p></li><li><p>SimpMaker 3K1: https://civitai.com/models/1258/aloeveras-simpmaker-3k-series</p></li><li><p>One ancient feet model that can be grabbed from some repositories (the only one I know of is too dubious to link it).</p></li><li><p>It also works GREAT as an extra style modifier with this hypernetwork for extra artistic outputs: https://civitai.com/models/1141/mjv4-hypernetwork</p></li></ul><p><u>TROUBLESHOOT:</u></p><ul><li><p>Images are a chaotic trip of LSD colors:</p></li></ul><p>You are not using the VAE.</p><ul><li><p>Images seem like real images but are a mess of body horror and whatnot:</p></li></ul><p>You need to keep working in your prompt. This is <u>NOT</u> an easy to use model (not rocket science either).</p><ul><li><p>Model gives error when trying to launch.</p></li></ul><p>I have totally no idea of what can be the problem, I am not a software developer, just a somewhat experienced user. However @Technerd has shared with us this info for an specific problem:</p><p>Technerd - "Python Error: Key Error: 'state_dict' pops up no images generated. Cannot get it to work with NMKD 1.8 GUI".</p><p>Technerd - "Just to let you know I've downloaded your new "safetensors" version and converted it via NMKD GUI to a "ckpt" file and now it works".</p><p><u>FUTURE:</u></p><p>This project is considered finished. From now on it is going to become my base model. I may start to train it as the big kids do. I may create a new merge in a future using it too. The sky is the limit, wanna be updated?</p><p>https://linktr.ee/ainecaptain</p><p>And if you wish to support me and get exclusive content such as evolutions of the model before they are released, lot's of NSFW pics made with it and what not...</p><p>https://www.patreon.com/user?u=84473395</p>
