<p>This is what i ended up with after a few days of mixing trying to get something capable of most of what I like and good quality. The model can generate anime girls and fairly realistic ones. For more realistic I recommend raising your cfg and sampling steps ik it says if you use euler a above SS 40 doesn't affect it but with this ckpt it seems to especially on realistic images, and the cfq scaling up typically is how i get the realistic images to look best. Its capable of monster girls and futa as well as changing skin colors. works best for 1 girl images.</p><p>basic positive prompt starts (optional)</p><p>(best quality:1.2), (high res:1.2), (detailed:1.2), (nsfw:1.1), anime</p><p>(best quality:1.2), (high res:1.2), (detailed:1.2), (nsfw:1.1), realistic</p><p>Simple negative prompts work best (unless you are targeting something specific or running into monster girls or futa when not wanted) from what I've seen just stuff like low res, poorly drawn, missing body parts, extra body parts, more than 5 fingers, huge ass, huge tits, malformed body, and maybe throw in speech bubbles and stuff depending on what results are turning up for you</p><p>Most the time I using one of the above prompts or an alteration of them but for the images I posted here half of them were made with 2 to 3 tags and the others were made with a little more effort.</p><p>P.S. If someone out there knows how to do this better and wants to take a look at this and improve it id appreciate bc merging anything into this is taking me too long now to keep working on it. Taking me like half a day to upload it here.</p>
