### 三、详情
<p>I first saw GobGirlz and was really excited for what it could do. After using it for a while it just consistently fell short of expectations to me. No offense to the model creator, it's still an excellent model, I just felt like it needed a little cleaning up. Well, I think I've done that. MajorX came to the rescue with his 2d POV model. It merged with GobGirlz excellently with some fantastic results and really made things pop quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>After that though I still felt like there was just a little something missing. I toyed around with quite a few combinations and landed on using Elldreth's Vivid (v1) Mix and it was also excellent. Note, you can't go overboard with Elldreth's Vivid otherwise it messes up all the features that MajorX 2d POV adds in there (the sex parts...). The result is something quite awesome that does GobGirlz in a spectacularly NSFW fashion (not that it wasn't NSFW already) and supports all the trigger words from both GobGirlz and MajorX 2d POV.</p><p></p><p>This does require the Anything v3 VAE (Attached for convenience). And because it includes Elldreth's Vivid, which in turn includes Dreamlike, there is a license on this, which is linked at the bottom of the description. Also, seeing as it includes MajorX POV and Elldreth's Vivid, it's capable of more than just goblin girls. It can do other things pretty well too.</p><p></p><p>NOTE: All prompts in the example images are using InvokeAI Syntax NOT Automatic1111 syntax. The main difference here is that 'term+' is equivalent to '(term)' ++ is equivalent to (()) and so on.</p><p></p><p>Also Also Note.... If you get a black image, that's a bug with the VAE, not with the model. Make sure you have the command argument --no-half-vae in your startup command line arguments to solve that issue.</p><p></p><p>Full Model Recipe:</p><p>Merge 1 = GobGirlz v1 (50%) + Major X's 2D POV Model v1.1 (50%)</p><p>Merge 2 = Merge 1 (75%) + Elldreth's Vivid Mix v1 (25%)</p><p></p><p>If you want to recreate something similar but without a license requirement, you could just recreate the Merge 1. this is still a fantastic merge at that point, it's just a little less, well... Vivid....</p><p></p><p>Models used in this merge:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/3660/gobgirlz">https://civitai.com/models/3660/gobgirlz</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/3662/major-xs-2d-pov-model">https://civitai.com/models/3662/major-xs-2d-pov-model</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/2747/elldreths-vivid-mix">https://civitai.com/models/2747/elldreths-vivid-mix</a></p><p></p><p>Dreamlike License:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0/blob/main/LICENSE.md">https://huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0/blob/main/LICENSE.md</a></p>
