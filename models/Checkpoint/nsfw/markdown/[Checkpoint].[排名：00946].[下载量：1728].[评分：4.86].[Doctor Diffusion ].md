<p>I've been working on this model for quite some time now, it started with a self trained model which has now been merged with several other open source models and fine tuned numerous times with multiple datasets ranging from 50-10,000 images. It does have some hardcore capabilities but it is by far strongest at generating images of individual women. It does best with 2:3 and 3:4 and other portrait orientation aspect ratios, but it can do some wide images as well. 1:1 images tend to end up with distorted faces or cropped super close. </p><p></p><p>It's pretty flexible with prompting and doesn't require a lot of negative prompts, I tend to include ((airbrushed)) as it helps the skin texture pretty substantially and anime, fake, cartoon. I'm not much of a prompter so I use a base prompt I pieced together from others and 6-8 wildcards to add variety but this model is pretty easy and flexible when it comes to prompts. Embeddings and Lora's work great with it, but in general it does not have a great grasp of specific celebrities/real people. It does do best when a name is included in the prompt.</p><p></p><p>Models which have been merged in to my own. Other than Liberty, there has been significant fine tuning following each merger :</p><p>Liberty:<a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/5935/liberty"> https://civitai.com/models/5935/liberty   </a>I had actually planned on uploading last night until I saw this model - a little trickier to prompt but really fantastic results. Highly recommended.</p><p>WoopWoop V1: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/4041/woopwoop-photo">https://civitai.com/models/4041/woopwoop-photo</a> - In my opinion this is one of the best models out there.</p><p>Izumi: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/1364/izumi">https://civitai.com/models/1364/izumi</a> - fantastic model.</p><p>There's likely one or two others I'm forgetting.</p><p></p><p>Next steps are improved tagging and curating of my larger datasets and continued fine tuning with the occasional merge thrown in, I will be posting updates as they become worthwhile.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p></p>
