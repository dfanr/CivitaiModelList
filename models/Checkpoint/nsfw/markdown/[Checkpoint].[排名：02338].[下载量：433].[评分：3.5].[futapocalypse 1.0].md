<p>This is a futa model built from hundreds of hours of research and training attempts. It is using fluffyrock-768-lion-low-lr-e38-offset-noise-e6 as a base. the base model this was trained on can be found in this discord server: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://discord.gg/furrydiffusion">https://discord.gg/furrydiffusion</a></p><p>CFG goes from 4-20+, sample steps go from 20-150 on Euler A with depreciating gains after 80 steps from my tests.</p><p>it's using E621 tags, not dabooru. you can get the autocomplete extension in the SD webui exstensions tab, then in the options you can switch to E621 for easy autocomplete.</p><p>futanari is the keyword, but gynomorph also works (furry art generation is possible with this tag).</p><p>i did my best to add all the good stuff, breast sizes go from flat chested -&gt; small breasts -&gt; medium breasts -&gt; big breasts -&gt; hyper breasts in that order. </p><p>ball size follows about the same as breast size.</p><p>it offers flaccid, erect, foreskin (retracted, partially retracted, unretracted). </p><p>it's not great at micropenis so watch out for that.</p><p>animal genitals work as well if your into that (canine/equine).</p><p>you're gonna need to use an artist name as a base, i use ricegnat for a more "waifu" look. but just about any artist on E621 with more than 50 images should work fine, you can even blend them by adding multiple artists!</p><p>noise offset was used, so you get great contrast!</p><p>the VAE i used was vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned, but you can experiment with others!</p><p>in the event of too much furry bleed through make sure to add "anthro, fur, tail" in the negative prompt or human in the prompt.</p><p>enjoy everyone!</p>
