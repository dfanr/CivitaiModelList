<p>This model is designed to capture the historical building techniques, vivid colors, sharpness, and richness of colors found in photographs of traditionally built homes and flowers from various parts of the world. However, this model may not be suitable for creating realistic people, as people typically appear in the background of photographs included in the dataset. That being said, when the phrase trigger word is not used or is de-emphasized by moving it to the end of the prompt, the effects can be quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>The examples I provide were made using the ckpt file.</p><p></p><p>I would love to see what you come up with so please post your results!<br /></p><p>To trigger the style this model is is trained on use <strong>phse</strong></p><p></p><p>The negative prompt I use in the examples was cutoff.
