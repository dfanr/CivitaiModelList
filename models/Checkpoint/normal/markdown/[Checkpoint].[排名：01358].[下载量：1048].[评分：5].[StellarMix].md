<h1>A mixture of my favourite checkpoints.</h1><p></p><p>This model merge was made during my spare time for fun, as I was curious about mixing completely different checkpoints together. I'm currently unsure if I will improve this checkpoint but I wanted to share because why not.</p><p>It's not great at extremely detailed backgrounds but I like its outcomes.</p><p>I'm fairly new to all this, so I apologise if I cannot answer questions.</p><p></p><h3>Simple Prompts</h3><p>Most of the images I've generated with this checkpoint are fairly straightforward to a certain extent. I haven't really tested very descriptive prompts but I would love to see if it's possible.</p><p></p><h3>NSFW Content</h3><p>This checkpoint is capable of doing NSFW content, although I haven't thoroughly tested it so I do not know the limitations.</p><p></p><h3>VAE</h3><p>No VAE was baked into this model, so you have the freedom to pick and play your sort of style. I was using <strong>Pastel Waifu Diffusion</strong> for most of my images. I have tested it with kl-f8-anime2 and that works too.</p><p></p><h3>Issues</h3><p>There does seem to be an issue with hair colours. For some reason, solid colours like black often generate blue highlights. I’m unsure what causes this, so if someone knows how it can be improved I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!</p><p></p><h3>Post your image generations!</h3><p>It would be great to see what sort of generations could be created from this checkpoint.</p><p></p><h3>Recommended Generation</h3><ul><li><p>Sampling Method: DPM++ 2M Karras</p></li><li><p>Steps: 25+</p></li><li><p>CFG: 5-7 (Not really played around - Usually did 7).</p></li><li><p>Clip Skip: 2</p></li><li><p>Hires.Fix: R-ESRGAN 4X+ Anime6B</p><ul><li><p>Hires Steps: 12-30</p></li><li><p>Denoising Strength: 0.4+</p></li><li><p>Upscale: 2</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>I also like to use 4x-UltraSharp on my images sometimes but that's definitely not required. </p><p></p><h3>Have fun generating those images! I look forward to seeing what gets created.</h3>
