### 三、详情
<p>This model is aimed at creating a distinct, expressive style for characters that's more on the drawn side of things. It's (somewhat loosely) based off of a private model which was in turn based off the excellent <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/2583/hassaku-hentai-model">Hassaku(NSFW)</a>, but has been trained a pretty good distance away from it. I've mostly trained it to create character art, but it'll still do NSFW just fine.<br /><br />Major Features:<br />More granular control of expressions and bodytypes, with a focus on really expressive faces.</p><p>Somehow I accidentally trained it to be pretty decent with guns. Mostly tested with assault rifles. It still requires inpainting in many cases.</p><p></p><p>Tips for using:<br />Occasionally it'll get really stubborn with a certain bodytype and requires higher negative weighting than ideal. It probably does know how to make what you're looking for, but if it gets stuck you may have to bludgeon it a bit.</p><p>Unless you're specific with backgrounds, it will default to simple ones. A few tags should do the trick.</p><p>For a few themes (mainly cyberpunk) it reverts to the more rendered style of its predecessor. Hopefully something I'm able to fix in the future.</p>
