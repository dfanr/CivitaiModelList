<p>The model name is an homage to the great Frank Frazetta. I made it to add in the style of some of my favorite artists (including Frazetta) I felt were not trained well enough in SD 1.5, or that weren't in it at all. All artists I have included have already passed away. Many come from the great pulp era of American publishing. I started with the same images used for another model, which the creator gave me and said that he won't be working on his any more. Then I cleaned up and edited all the text files, then added several more artists, adding a couple of hundred more training images in all. I haven't magically made hands always work or anything like that - you'll still need to inpaint for that. And I have used no inpainting for the sample images. I have simply cherrypicked a few I thought were good results.</p><p>Using the model should be pretty simple. Using the keyword "painting" will pull pretty hard to a mixed style. Other than that, you can use the artist names. Using "Fake Fauxzetta" won't do you any good.</p><ul><li><p>Allen Anderson</p></li><li><p>Earle Bergey</p></li><li><p>Frank Frazetta</p></li><li><p>George Gross</p></li><li><p>Gil Elvgren</p></li><li><p>Glen Orbik</p></li><li><p>Robert Maguire</p></li><li><p>Robert Stanley</p></li><li><p>Tom Lovell</p></li></ul><p>Also, using keywords for pulp magazine genres will halp: western, scifi, fantasy, mystery, crime, romance...</p><p>Most of the description texts were in the following format:</p><p>a painting, by {artist}; a {subject}, {description of what the subject is wearing/doing}; a {another subject}, {description of what that subject is wearing/doing}; ... {info about the background or setting}; {genre tag and other important keywords}</p><p>So formatting your prompts like that will probably help yeild decent results.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>a painting, by Robert Maguire; a boxer, standing in the ring; dramatic lighting, action</p></li><li><p>a painting, by George Gross; a woman, sitting on a motorcycle; at night, in the city, masterpiece, HQ</p></li></ul><p>This model is trained at 512x512, and based on SD 1.5. I can only train at 512x512, as my video card is not a screaming beast. Maybe someday I'll take donations, and with them buy a nicer card and be able to produce a SD 2.1 version, and release my higher-res data set.</p><p>I don't really care what you do with this model, as long as it's legal. I just want to give something back to this community.</p><p>I used a set of instructions I found somewhere to make an inpainting version of the model, too. See the tab at the top of the model.</p><p>If you think you can do better than me at training a model, you are welcome to the data set I used. <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/9tig5ha7b50i1to/FakeFauxzetta-data-set.zip/file">https://www.mediafire.com/file/9tig5ha7b50i1to/FakeFauxzetta-data-set.zip/file</a></p><p></p>
