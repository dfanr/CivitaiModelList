<p>"THE LAST GATHERING</p><p>Standing on the last minutes of mankind, the end felt bittersweet, full of warm memories of the past. With each dimming light, they were saying goodbye to each other, looking in the face of a merciless future.</p><p>It was the last gathering around the bonfire, to tell the stories of humankind, sing and drink together whilst sitting on their whole lives fit into small compartments. They shared their stories, their laughter and tears blending together in the symphony of life. They sang songs, old and new, and raised their glasses in a final toast to the world that had been, and the world that would never be.</p><p>For some, it was a time of sorrow, for others, it was a time of peace. But as the last embers of the bonfire flickered and died, they knew that they had lived and loved, and that was all that mattered in the grand scheme of things. They were ready to face the darkness, together, as one."<br /><br />===============================================<br /><br />This model holds a special place in my heart, as I have spent a great deal of time training, mixing and refining it to create "The Last Gathering" - short story about acceptance of the inevitable and finding comfort in each other's company in the face of the end. It's not about desperation, but about bittersweet goodbye that feels warm and nostalgic. It's understanding that all the good things have to end.<br /><br />Model has undergone countless changes and improvements, and I now feel that it is ready to be shared with others. Enjoy.</p>
