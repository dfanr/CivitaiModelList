### 三、详情
<p>As always, the example images I've posted have NO postwork done to them beyond the facial fix (in some cases) and upscaling. The point is to show how well it works out of the box - if you take the time and create really good prompts and use good negative prompts (an example is at the end of this post) you can get even better results.</p><p></p><p>This is likely (assuming that there are no glaring issues or problems with this version) <strong>the final version of this model</strong>. If there are some discoveries I make which provide huge improvements to things, I might reconsider, but as of this writing, I'm very happy and satisfied, so it's time to move on and start training some new things and getting to work on my game engine.</p><p></p><p>(Updated for v.4.6 Another Final Version, June 22, 2023)<br />(Updated for <strong>V4.5 FINAL VERSION</strong>: May 18,2023)<br />(Updated "Triggers" Sections: May, 15, 2023)</p><p></p><h2 id="heading-6382">Intro</h2><p>I wanted a model or workflow process that allowed me to quickly and easily churn out art for games and/or photo stories. I didn't want long complicated prompts to create a certain art style, but I also didn't want to be forced to use LoRa's and TI's for every character. Unfortunately, most of the models where I loved the art styles didn't do so well of loading characters (celebrities for mixing, fictional characters, etc.) and the ones that knew tons of famous characters and people tended not take to the art styles I was going for (at least not without complex prompts).</p><p></p><h2 id="heading-6383">Triggers:</h2><p><strong>New (Version 4.6 Additions)</strong>: </p><p>Anything from the <a rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/90350/xenoengine-6th-sense">6th Sense XenoEngine</a> should generally work. Some of the things merged in aren't perfect so they can mess up the style, look like garbage, or otherwise come out craptacularly. (I need to experiment yet, but complex things could probably be helped with a good "bad hands" negative prompt. On some things that work, you might need to up the weights a bit, too. e.g. <em>(Romulan:1.3)</em>. Sometimes at low weights for some of these things - you can get a clothing upgrade without changing the appearance so much. In one of the sample images I did, I had it too low to see the "race" change, but it did put her in proper Sci-Fi themed attire (not quite accurate regulation Star Trek, but definitely obvious that that is what it was going for. <strong>Play around - let me know what works and what sucks. </strong><br /><br />NOTE: I'm not sure how well the Subreddit triggers are working. Will update as I learn more. </p><p><strong>DIGITAL ART</strong></p><p><strong>CARTOON</strong></p><p><strong>MASTERPIECE</strong></p><p><strong>&lt;SIZE&gt; BREASTS - &lt;SIZE&gt; ASS - &lt;SIZE&gt; BELLY</strong><br />Small - Medium - Large - Gigantic (See below for "Flat Chest" - "Small" does NOT necessarily make breasts smaller.) Just about anything with the word "breasts" in it is going to make them bigger. The more weight you use (and for Large and Gigantic calls) the higher the tendency to make it NSFW by default. (Call your outfits and use SFW in the prompt. NSFW in the negative prompt helps, too.</p><p><strong>HYPERBREASTS</strong></p><p><strong>HYPERASS</strong></p><p><strong>FLAT CHEST</strong><br />This does a pretty good job of getting the breasts smaller. The weight of this is fairly low in the model so just saying "flat chest" will give very subtle looks. Play with the weights a bit. Depending upon the subject, something like (flat_chest:1.5) give or take 0.1 either way will give them a nearly flat chest. Numbers between 1 and that top point will move along the scale between normal and flat. <em>Usually</em>.</p><p><strong>DETAILED EYE</strong><br />This will give the eyes more detail, but it also tends to drive the camera up to closeup shots - and doesn't really do all that much on anything further back than a cowboy shot. Expect usage of this to change the nature of the shot and either call your camera angle in the prompt or use EasyPose/Controlnet to force the character where you want them.</p><p><strong>ADD DETAIL</strong><br />Based upon the <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/58390/detail-tweaker-lora-lora">Detail Tweaker LoRa</a> - I baked in just a smidge of this (so there's no real reason or need to use it again with this model). Just put add_detail into the prompt with a weight (higher or lower as desired) to tweak the detail levels.</p><h2 id="heading-6384">Fun Triggers</h2><p>These are not really things I purposely put into the model, but that produce fun and/or interesting results. These triggers may very well work with other models you use, too.</p><p><strong>Feminization</strong>: Something like "Chuck Norris, feminization," along with whatever else you want in a prompt will create something that would be maybe what Chuck Norris would look like as a woman.</p><p><strong>Sanpaku</strong>: shrinks the iris of the eye a bit making more of the eye whites show and giving them a bit more detailed look. Increase the weight to make the irises even smaller (and more whites showing).</p><p></p><p><strong>See "Version Details" to the right for minor revision update notes. </strong>This post will be updated with major notes, triggers, and other long-term items.</p><h2 id="heading-6385">V4 Update Notes</h2><p>Rebuilt from the ground up... got rid of some garbage (and pruned it down to half its original size) tweaked some weights that were bothering me, and generally got things cleaned up. I'm not <em>quite </em>happy with the style consistency, yet - but this is a good clean start on things.<br /><br />NOTE: The trigger words listed are just the ones that were specifically added on top of the SD Base Model - and really only the ones I've found useful to make good tweaks and adjustments. This model is great at knowing art styles, people, and concepts that you might love (and/or hate) from the base model.<br /><br />I also forgot one ingredient when adding hyperfusion - so it tends to go porny/nude when you start playing with breasts. I won't have time to update/fix until this weekend so... expect to have to do some work to add clothes if you're playing with breast sizes. Sorry about that.</p><p></p><h2 id="heading-6386">V3.X Update Notes</h2><p>Keywords "Masterpiece" and "add_detail" will enhance (or back down if negative levels are used).</p><p>This also responds to the Hyperfusion triggers (see version 3.2 notes) as well as all the <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/2220/babes">custom art styles from Babes</a>. (Plus many many more - but the Babes trained styles are ones likely not to be found in many other models).</p><p>A bonus (from Hyperfusion) is that it also lets you accomplish making breasts smaller - something very difficult to do on most models without bringing in a lot of extra help. With this "flat_chest:1.4" (or thereabouts) will do a nice job of shrinking things down in most cases. You can also use all the triggers from hyperfusion to make the breasts, butt, and belly do all sorts of things - and putting in weights there brings varied results too. <br /><br />NOTE: At low levels, most of those calls don't go crazy by sexing everyone up. The higher your weights, the more likely that is to happen, so you may need to declare SFWs and even call a specific outfit in some cases. (I had to do that in the big bust sample image). <br /><br />All previous triggers and keywords will still work, too.</p><h2 id="heading-6387"><br />Some notes on the model:</h2><ul><li><p>It "mostly" defaults to SFW out of the box. i.e. If you just type in a person's name or character description with no clothes - it'll tend to put them in clothes - or at least a swimsuit. That said... with proper prompting, does nudes and porny stuff just fine, too.</p></li><li><p>I didn't care so much about making sure resulting characters look "exactly" like the person you're calling out so much as wanting to make sure that if I called out that name/person again - they'd be consistent in the way they look from image to image. So, in other words, it's not so much about "accuracy" as it is about "consistency" - and that seems to come through. (This works well for my needs to create stories and whatnot)<br /></p></li></ul><p><strong>Good Negative Prompt for this Model</strong><br /><em>canvas frame, 3d, ((disfigured)), ((bad art)), ((deformed)),((extra limbs)),((b&amp;w)), blurry, (((duplicate))), ((morbid)), ((mutilated)), [out of frame], extra fingers, mutated hands, ((poorly drawn hands)), ((poorly drawn face)), (((mutation))), (((deformed))), ((ugly)), blurry, ((bad anatomy)), (((bad proportions))), ((extra limbs)), cloned face, (((disfigured))), out of frame, ugly, extra limbs, (bad anatomy), gross proportions, (malformed limbs), ((missing arms)), ((missing legs)), (((extra arms))), (((extra legs))), mutated hands, (fused fingers), (too many fingers), (((long neck))), ugly, tiling, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn feet, poorly drawn face, out of frame, mutation, mutated, extra limbs, extra legs, extra arms, disfigured, deformed, cross-eye, body out of frame, blurry, bad art, bad anatomy, Scribbles, Low quality, Low rated, Mediocre, 3D rendering, Screenshot, Software, UI, watermark, signature, distorted pupils, distorted eyes, (distorted face), Unnatural anatomy, strange anatomy, things on face, ((tattoo)), ((tattoos)),</em></p><p></p><p>Obviously, some of those may want to be removed if you're going for something that has been excluded.</p>
