<p>This is my own mix. Its goal was to be kind of a "jack of all trades" model.<br /><br />It basically come from an experiment i did when i was drunk where i mixed some models together to try and get a mix able to do semi-realistic images which can lean into anime or more realism depending on what you prompt.<br />I find it useful because it can work with anime AND realistic loras, although sometimes you will have to fiddle with the settings for the latter. (apologies in advance to heterosexual people for the futa in the preview images, but that's to prove that point : it have been made using the realistic Tgirl lora. : <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/8328/tgirls">https://civitai.com/models/8328/tgirls</a> )<br /><br />I also apologize for anyone who would have liked to remake it at home but i have NO idea of the exact recipe.<br />I just remember that the base is a mix of AOM3 and easter (an old model trained on ehentai images that is really, REALLY bad alone but can enhance others models by allowing to understand some obscure concepts), and that i incorporated metagod real realism to it once i sobered up.<br /><br />I'm sharing it because i want to give back to the community and review all the lora i use. Since i will be using this model for some of the reviews, i thought it would be a good idea to upload it.<br /><br /><strong>___________________________________________________</strong><br /><br />So!<br />The model produces semi-realistic images and can lean a bit to the anime side or toward a more realistic artstyle.<br /><br /><br /><strong>for an anime style</strong>, add "anime", "drawing" to the prompt. "perfect eyes" is also recommended to prevent having a mix of realistic and anime eyes.<br /><br /><strong>for a more realistic artstyle</strong>, use "RAW", "Hyperrealistic", or/and the usual prompts fillers used for "realistic" models. Metagod real realism previews will help for that.<br /><br />Note that this model will <em>never</em> produce true photorealistic images (even if it gets close sometimes ). But it was never its goal.<br />Vanilla SD, ares and metagod real realism will help you if it's what you're searching for.<br /><br />This model is not good at drawing dogs. It's okay, i'm more of a cat person.<br /><br /><strong>The original SD vae is recommended, i didn't baked any.</strong><br /><br />I hope this mix will be useful to you, your desires, and your fantasies.</p>
