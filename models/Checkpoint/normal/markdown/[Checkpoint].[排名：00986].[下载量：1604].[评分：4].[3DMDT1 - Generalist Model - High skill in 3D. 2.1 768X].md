<p>Hi guys. This is a work that I have been developing for weeks uninterruptedly. It all started with a desire to create a more 3D-oriented model, generating images as if they were generated in Blender/Unreal and other 3D editing tools. I got good results in 3D.</p><p>After that together with my friend Shadow, from the PRMJ model, I was able to improve both models by making modifications and creating a generalist model that delivers good results in a high range of prompts. Although it is focused more on 3D, I got good results in landscapes, portrait, photorealism, illustrations, among others.</p><p>The most important part of the models to understand a prompt well. If you want something more photorealistic, put in keywords for photos such as raw photo, etc. Now if you want a 3d render, put 3d render word on it.</p><p>Because the model is more focused on 3d rendering, if you don't insert anything it will create something more 3d related than photorealistic.</p><p>All images in the gallery were made using DPM 2M++ Karras 30 Steps. No embeddings. Negative prompts standard. No face restore.</p><p><strong>I really hope you like the model and use it.</strong></p><p></p><p>If you like the model and think it is worth it you can make a donation to my <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=81570187">patreon</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://ko-fi.com/jvkape">ko-fi</a>, buy me a coffe.<strong> All money received is reverted to make GPU TIME rent since I don't have a local machine with GPU.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>I would like to thank the help and support of;</strong></p><ul><li><p>Shadow_Shinigami</p></li><li><p>Mousewrites</p></li><li><p>PePPa</p></li><li><p>Queria Star Morta</p></li><li><p>PublicPrompts</p></li></ul>
