<h2>Model presentation</h2><p>This is a model related to the "Challenge of the WeekEnd" contest on <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://discord.gg/stablediffusion">Stable Diffusion discord</a>.</p><p>You can find this dataset in a more complete model, <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/44230/sdart-complete-edition">SDArt : Complete Edition</a>.</p><p><u>This present version is trained on dedicated tokens per user, and doesn't work like you may be used to.</u></p><p></p><p>I try to make a model out of all the submissions, for people to continue enjoy the theme after the event, and see a little of their designs in other people's creations. The token stays "SDArt" and I balance the learning on the low side, so that it doesn't just replicate creations.</p><p></p><p><strong>The pictures were tagged using the token "SDArt", and an arbitrary token given to the user that submitted it</strong>.</p><p></p><p>The dataset is available below and is composed of 31 pictures.</p><h2><br /><strong>This week's theme</strong></h2><p><strong>[LOG #77 X-7829F TRANSCRIPT]</strong></p><p><em>Hello..? Is this recording?</em></p><p><em>This may be sudden and surprising but.. I'm from the future! Well, a future.</em></p><p><em>I found a watch that allowed me to project into the past - I was a little skeptical at first but figured it was worth a shot. So, I dialed in 2023 and appeared in front of a group of people in some sort of white coats who were wearing some seriously outdated clothing. I chuckled to myself and told them about our tech-infused fashion in my future. They started experimenting with new materials and designs, and before I knew it, they were creating some impressive pieces!</em></p><p><em>Of course, I couldn't resist sending a few more messages back in time. I gave them some hints for creating even more innovative fashion, and they ate it up. It was amazing to see how my small advice could change the course of history.</em></p><p><em>As I projected closer and closer into the future, I could see the world evolving around items of clothing. One of the designers caught my eye with their creation of a smart jacket. The jacket was made with a special fabric that could regulate body temperature and adjust itself according to the weather. Another designer had created a dress that could change color based on your mood. How cool is that? Talk about wearing your emotions on your sleeve!</em></p><p><em>But the pièce de résistance was a pair of shoes that could charge your phone! Yes, you heard that right. The shoes had a built-in charger that converted the kinetic energy generated by walking into electrical energy. Gone were the days of simple aesthetics. Fashion had evolved into something that was not only innovative but also functional.</em></p><p><em>And so, here we are in 20XX! Who knows, maybe we'll have fashion that can teleport us to different dimensions next...</em></p><p><em>...</em></p><p><em>Oh.</em></p><p><strong>COW #1 - FUTURISTIC FASHION</strong></p><p>Step into the future and create a character! :mm:</p><p>Explore the world of high-tech fashion where style intersects innovation.
