<p>This Model is a Experiment.</p><p>All models used, i have had tested and they produce independently of each other good results, sadly i dont have much time rn and would like to see this concept model being tested, i did test it a bit but mostly the steps inbetween and now im burned out lmao.</p><p></p><p>Have Fun with it and maybe surgest some more Photorealistic models i could merge into it, of course all other kinds of feeback is wanted aswell :)</p><p></p><p>I might do a list of models used... but not today lol</p><p></p><p>Btw, 57 total amounts of models used in the merge, not counting models inside of the merged models, NSWF models might be too influential... will take some time to filter models for a non NSWF version.</p><p></p><p>Edit: I started a stress test series i give it a 7/10 with my prompt sets, i will start a larger trail series to filter the used models, but for a much improved version it will take weeks do to hardware limitations, but it should deliver good results.</p>
