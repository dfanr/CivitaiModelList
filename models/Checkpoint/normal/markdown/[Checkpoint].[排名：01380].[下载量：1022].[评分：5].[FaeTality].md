<h1 id="faetality"><strong>FaeTality</strong></h1><p><strong>Please read the description below for model information!</strong></p><p>This is the second model mix that I have publicly released. Originally started as a version upgrade for FaeTastic...I fell in love with it and decided that it needed its own unique name and space. </p><p>Like FaeTastic this is a very versatile model that does have the Noise Offset included. I still love FaeTastic and I use it regularly in my work still, but FaeTality I find it to be a bit more creative and also makes some <em>amazing</em> eye details. </p><p>I use the F8Anime2 VAE for this model, but the 840k also works perfectly well too. If your colors are appearing washed out, then you need to install and use the VAE properly. </p><p></p><h2 id="almost-all-images-utilized-loopback-scaler"><strong>Almost all images utilized </strong><a rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/23188/loopback-scaler"><strong>Loopback Scaler. </strong></a></h2><p>I very highly recommend this script as it does some awesome stuff (why the images example images are highly detailed with awesome vibrant coloring!!). For any images not utilizing it, I instead used the SD Upscale. I've written a guide here going over it for those not versed in upscaling: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://ko-fi.com/post/The-Double-Headed-Issue-E1E0JO2UV">https://ko-fi.com/post/The-Double-Headed-Issue-E1E0JO2UV</a></p><p>When I have time I plan on publishing some article guides on Civit going over the Loopback Scaler and how to utilize it properly. </p><p>This model mix has been a several month long process in the making as I am highly picky about the quality of things that I want to release. That's why I don't churn out things on here (I have A LOT of models and TIs/LORAs but am very anxious about releasing them unless I feel like they've attained high standards!). It probably took hundreds of merges and a crapton of playing with merge sliders to figure out things.
