### 三、详情
<p>This model should be considered "Beta" - and, as such, there will likely be a bit of instability with certain things you're trying to do but that I haven't gotten conceptually trained well enough.</p><p>This checkpoint is the result of my desire to make highly capable yet simple to prompt models that will produce consistent output. The "simple to prompt" bit is working pretty well, here, but there's some room for improvement in the "consistent output" department. Put someone in a different scenario and their style and look can start to change. Calling for a specific style can help - but I'll also be working on getting this working better in future updates.</p><p>By default, this model produces a sort of <strong>semi-real analog photo/IRAY Render, with a hint of dreaminess</strong>. Mostly.</p><p><strong>Like it? </strong><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/IAmXenos"><strong>Buy me a beer</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p><p>This model has been merged and trained with various other trained models and LoRa's. I'll be updating this post with notes on some of the trigger phrases that are working well and that are somewhat unique to this model. Check back in a day or two.</p><p>When combining these trained models, I lowered their influence a bit to ensure that they didn't take over all the time. As such, you sometimes need to increase the weight just a smidge to get things working. (e.g. <em>(Vulcan:1.2) Ambassador</em>).</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/80819/subreddit-v6"><strong>Subreddit</strong></a>: This will often make your subjects get a more "amateur model" look - but then again, that's often what we're going for. Don't forget to prefect the tokens with r/ (e.g. r/girlsgonewild).</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/17564/species"><strong>Species</strong></a>: This one is a lot of fun! Some don't work particularly well, but others are way cool.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/12330?modelVersionId=15330"><strong>Luna's Angels</strong></a>: Does a nice job of ethnicity related skin colors (and seems to have helped unlock skin colors from "species" and maybe some other places, too. I'm really excited about how well this works - getting ethnicities is always hard and, with the models I've used, getting a dark skinned beauty is tough... it's a bit easier now, hopefully.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/64627/vr-porn"><strong>VR Porn</strong></a>: Has a few sexual positions that work fairly well. Call your sexual partner on most of them or you'll have disembodied genitals and whatnot. lol</p>
