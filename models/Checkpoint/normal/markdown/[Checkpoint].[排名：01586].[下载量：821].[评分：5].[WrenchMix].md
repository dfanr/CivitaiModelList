<p>This is a merge of my 3 favorite models/mixes:<br /><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/50041/mothmix">MothMix</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/7371/rev-animated">ReV Animated</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/5414">Pastel-Mix [Stylized Anime Model]</a></p><p>This merge started as a curious question with other people at civitai discord, "What will happen if i 50/50 merge Rev Animated with Mothmix?" The results were great. So I tried merging Pastel-mix in it too to give that pastely effect but keeping the properties of previous merge. And this is the result. I hope it didn't caught my bad hands curse.<br /></p><p><strong>NOTE: This mix is based on my personal tastes.</strong></p><p></p><h3>Recommended config</h3><p><strong>Sampler:</strong> DPM++ 2M Karras</p><p><strong>Sampling Steps:</strong> 25-40</p><p><strong>Upscaler:</strong> 4x-UltraSharp</p><p><strong>CFG Scale:</strong> 5-10 (what I usually use with any model)</p><p><strong>Denoising strength:</strong> 0.2-0.7</p><p><strong>Clip Skip:</strong> 2</p><p><strong>Vae:</strong> None(if you want washed style), Blessed-fix</p><p><strong>Enable Quantization in K samplers</strong></p><p>Lower cfg gives more pastlish style while higher gives more 2.5Dish style</p><p></p><p>The images are not cherry picked, these are simple hires fix 2x upscaled images that are generated while reviewing few chan LoRA that we people at civitai discord server been working on. Although some seeds were repeated with updated prompts to get details like hands, extra limbs correct.</p><p></p><h2>Credits</h2><p>Author of Rev Animated: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/s6yx">s6yx</a></p><p>Author of Pastel-Mix [Stylized Anime Model]: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/andite">andite</a></p><p>Author of MothMix: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/bombasticmori">bombasticmori</a></p><p>Do check their content and support them for their amazing work.</p><p></p><h2>Recipe</h2><p>As a software dev, I don't like to make simple things complex. So here are the exact screenshots of the merge window.</p><p>NOTE: ReV Animated was first pruned to fp16 since I like to keep them as small as possible.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p><img src="https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/87663fe5-fd6c-4793-ae02-316a866f4f72/width=525/87663fe5-fd6c-4793-ae02-316a866f4f72.jpeg" /><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p><img src="https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/7c666ca1-a8b9-4997-9ef4-83dada391991/width=525/7c666ca1-a8b9-4997-9ef4-83dada391991.jpeg" /><p>Easy as that.</p><p></p><h2>License</h2><p>This model is open access and available to all, with a CreativeML OpenRAIL-M license further specifying rights and usage.
