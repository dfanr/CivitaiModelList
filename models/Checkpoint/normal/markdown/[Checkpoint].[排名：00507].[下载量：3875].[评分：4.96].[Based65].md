<h3>THE PRUNED MODEL IS PROTO-MIX THE FULL MODEL IS FINAL-MIX</h3><p>and basically with the image examples </p><p><strong>LEFT is Proto-Mix</strong></p><p><strong>RIGHT is Final-Mix</strong></p><p></p><h3><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://mega.nz/file/qExmQBQA#9eyI78TMEJu8V4c84UWitrlDAjyqxrxSVc1D5ktb87k">CC License</a></h3><p>I initially wanted to upload all the based-mixes onto one page but alas it doesn't work that way here, make sure you look at the <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://huggingface.co/AnonymousM/Based-mixes">huggingface repo I created to host ALL Based-mixes I have made so far along with all future entries that will be uploaded here too</a>. Pruned versions with the <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://github.com/arenasys/stable-diffusion-webui-model-toolkit">model toolkit extension</a> will be uploaded there as well for all previous Based-mixes and future Based mixes.</p><p></p><p>Based65 proto and finalmix were made with the aid of the Supermerger extension</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://github.com/hako-mikan/sd-webui-supermerger">https://github.com/hako-mikan/sd-webui-supermerger</a></p><p></p><p>Finalmix also included the usage of <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://github.com/bbc-mc/sdweb-merge-block-weighted-gui">the MBW extension</a></p><p></p><p>65 was made with using <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://huggingface.co/grugger/chubas/resolve/main/models/mirrors/hll3vtubers-last-pruned.safetensors">HLL3's final epoch</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://huggingface.co/WarriorMama777/OrangeMixs">AOM2_hard</a> as the base, however despite me throwing some random mixes I liked to stray further away from AOM2's hard look (that realistic rib look that I didn't really like which also showed up on Based64) while maintaining its NSFW capabilities "Based65-Final-Mix" despite it's great appearance seems to have a harder time getting precise LORA details compared to protomix and Based64, the reason for this? It's due to the fact that apparently within the models I mixed some already included finetuned models that I wasn't aware of which CAN affect LORA compatibility so for example if your LORA details have trouble showing up on Based65-Final-mix the reason for that is due to more than 2 finetuned models were included in the mixing recipe, going above 2 seems to make LORA compatibility wonky, so my plan with the future Based mixes is to ensure that I take a close look at the creation process of the random models I put into my mixes and ensure that they're just another basic Anime model mix so I have an easier time ensuring that myself and users using my mix can easily generate "close to accurate" details with their baked LORAs.</p><p></p><p>So basically,</p><p></p><p><strong>BE WARNED IF YOU PLAN ON USING 65-FINAL-MIX IN YOUR MERGES</strong></p><p>Using proto-mix should be fine because I can only recall 2 "finetuned" models being used in the merge, I might just need to understand MBW a bit more to make LORA compatibility better with potential future Based-mixes using more models I'm unaware that are actually finetuned merges but for now I'll be keeping an eye out and putting more focus on the origins of the models I put within the mixing recipe for future models, which I didn't do for 64 and 65.</p><p></p><p>Yeah model merging takes time, well AI image stuff takes times once you decide to go beyond generating stuff so <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://linktr.ee/anonymousm">please support me on my socials or platforms where I post outputs from my models/LORAs or platforms where you can support me financially by donating/hiring me for services on the obvious platforms listed on this linktree</a>, the money will be used to get bigger NVME SSDs that don't have garbage file caching so model merging doesn't have stupid moments where it's stuck and I have to reset the whole process.</p><p></p>
