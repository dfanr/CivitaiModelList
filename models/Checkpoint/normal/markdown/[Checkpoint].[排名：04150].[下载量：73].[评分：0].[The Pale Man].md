### 三、详情
<p>Del Toro has long been an inspiration to me since I first saw his 2006 masterpiece "Pans Labyrinth". A fantastic fusion of horror and fantasy, fully displaying his creative genius and unrivalled to this day. As a tribute to his work, I decided to take his freakiest creation, "The Pale Man" and try to capture its entirety in dreambooth. Built on 55 images taken from a lifesize model, a lifesize bust and some denoised screenshots. Trained at 768 resolution for 5k steps with 2k class images. </p><p>I don't expect a lot of interest in this sort of freakish model but, I will be happy to see it reach even just a few like minded fans of fantasy macabre and thought it was worth sharing here.</p><p>I've spent countless hours optimising my workflow for this type of full figure checkpoint in dreambooth and I have quite a few models I will now start releasing on a weekly basis.</p>
