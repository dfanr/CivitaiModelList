<p>Buildings and landscapes - MM 3.5v</p><p></p><p>You will need to make sure both the safesensor and yaml config file are downloaded and installed in the same directory or you wont get the proper results, with so many merges this is part of the model makeup.  The config file is located just below the download button on the civitai model page for this model.</p><p></p><p><strong>Donations can be made </strong><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://ko-fi.com/asmrgaming">Buy asmrgaming a Coffee. </a><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="http://ko-fi.com/asmrgaming">ko-fi.com/asmrgaming</a><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://ko-fi.com/asmrgaming"> - Ko-fi ❤️ Where creators get support from fans through donations, memberships, shop sales and more! The original 'Buy Me a Coffee' Page.</a></p><p></p><p><strong>works fine with easy diffusion UI as well - which is the program i use to run it, automatic1111 and stable diffusion WebUI are fine with the config file placed alongside the saftensor - config file will be in a light blue message on the upper right side of this page on the download screen.</strong></p><p></p><p>To find other models search for "mega model" or search my username info.</p><p></p><p>Credit to all the model makers, merges and the community in general without which this wouldnt be possible. Hope u all enjoy it and feel free to merge it into your own models as well - im interested to see what people do with this (this is a general acknowledgement to all model producers here, because if i listed 2200 models that have been merged there wouldnt be enough space and there would be complaints about clutter) so the above is a general acknowledgement to all of civitai and huggingface model producers</p>
