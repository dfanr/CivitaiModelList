### 三、详情
<p>VERSION 2.2 HAS ARRIVED, PLEASE ENJOY (CONTROLNET BAKED IN FOR IMPROVED IMAGE GENERATION). For 2.2 you will need to make sure both the safesensor and yaml config file are downloaded and installed in the same directory or you wont get the proper results. this is because of multi language support built into the model based on the alt-diffusion model - mostly for chinesse, french, spanish and a few other language specific models that can work with english and vise versa.</p><p></p><p>Easy Diffusion Can we downloaded here, they are currently looking for developers who can code up contributions to merge LORA files directly into main models in an easy way, something that should be possible but automatic1111 doesnt have yet. U can add a comment on the pull reques there <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://github.com/cmdr2/stable-diffusion-ui">cmdr2/stable-diffusion-ui: Easiest 1-click way to install and use Stable Diffusion on your own computer. Provides a browser UI for generating images from text prompts and images. Just enter your text prompt, and see the generated image. (</a><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="http://github.com">github.com</a><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://github.com/cmdr2/stable-diffusion-ui">)</a> and download it too. Its easier to get into for newbies than other stable diffusion programs</p><p></p><p><strong>Sitting at 1350 Models merged together currently</strong>. - This is 2.2 with controlnet now added for improved image generation.  Very sharp images, please explore prompts and themes, and review and post pictures, if u find any weaknesses let me know as 2.3 is in development and these models are an iterative process of improvement with each release.</p><p>Im happy for other model users to use this model for mergers, it is a very powerful beast that gets results</p><p></p><p>Both fp16 versions can be found across the left tabs where versions are now listed on <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="http://civitai.com">civitai.com</a> after their recent website update. A 32 and 16fp sized file (yes they are big please do not clutter up comments about size , it is what it is if its to much then just pass on the model, the fp16 will be up tomorrow so u can access the 14.8gb or the 6.8gb by then.</p><p></p><p><strong>works fine with easy diffusion UI as well - which is the program i use to run it, automatic1111 and stable diffusion WebUI are fine with the config file placed alongside the saftensor - config file will be in a light blue message on the upper right side of this page on the download screen.</strong></p><p></p><p>To find other models search for "mega model" or search my username info.</p><p></p><p>Credit to all the model makers, merges and the community in general without which this wouldnt be possible. Hope u all enjoy it and feel free to merge it into your own models as well - im interested to see what people do with this</p><p></p><p>My username is u/ollobrains on reddit if u have any questions u can drop me a line there</p>
