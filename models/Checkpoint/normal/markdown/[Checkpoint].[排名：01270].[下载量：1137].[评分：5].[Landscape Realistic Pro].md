### 三、详情
<h2 id="heading-1488">About this model</h2><p>Welcome to <strong>Landscape Realistic Pro 1</strong>, a custom <strong>Stable Diffusion</strong> model that can generate stunning images of landscapes and scenery. This model is created by me, CellyOcillus, and it is based on the <strong>Cheese Daddy's Landscapes mix | OFFSET NOISE: </strong><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/15037?modelVersionId=18512"><strong>https://civitai.com/models/15037?modelVersionId=18512</strong></a><strong> + Landscape_PhotoReal: </strong><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/71987/landscapephotoreal"><strong>https://civitai.com/models/71987/landscapephotoreal</strong></a>. I have improved it by adding the Txt2Img mode, which allows you to input text and get an image based on it. You can also use negative prompts to suppress unwanted features. For example, “snowy mountain”. This model can produce realistic and detailed images that will amaze you and your viewers. If the original creators of base models thinks there are some factors such as policies or other problems with this model, please tell our group immediately and this model will abide to the rules of the base models(with some beta policies as extension).</p><h2 id="heading-1489">How to use this model</h2><p>To use this model, you need to have Stable Diffusion installed on your device. You can download it from here: AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui: Stable Diffusion web UI (<a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="http://github.com">github.com</a>)</p><p>Once you have Stable Diffusion, you can download my model from this page and load it on your device. Then you can start generating images by typing text prompts. For example, “a tropical beach with palm trees”. You can also adjust the parameters of the model to change the quality and diversity of the outputs. For example, you can use upscaler such as Topaz Gigapixel or the Ultra Sharp 4x model to enhance the resolution and sharpness of the images.</p><p>Best step count is around 30~50(too less = simple render, too much = too noisy due to reprocessing).</p><h2 id="heading-1490">Terms and conditions(Policies)</h2><p>I’m happy to share this model with you and I hope you enjoy using it.
