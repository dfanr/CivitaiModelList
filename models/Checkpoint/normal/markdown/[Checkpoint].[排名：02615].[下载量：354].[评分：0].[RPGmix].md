On that note, some introduced types of characters will generate with certain features, such as bloodsplatter if you choose "barbarian" or "warrior" for example, or interesting choices for makeup of different fantasy characters such as a witch or demon etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>I highly recommend that you also check out the other models</strong> for generation guidance. The required VAE for FaeTastic was baked in, so using the usual SD1.5 ema VAE will give you good results.</p><p></p><p>Cranking up pixarstyle too much, or giving emphasis to big eyes will give you problems of pupils not rendering correctly, and Codeformer or Gfgan will have trouble fixing that, or will completely change the face, remove the smoothness and lighting of faces.</p><p>Generating closeups at decent resolutions don't require a face restoration in my experience.</p><p></p><p>If you are looking for a strong fantasy style, adding hypermaximalist ornate and intricate to the prompt will make clothings and accessories stand out alot, and is usually not something you would see in an animated picture like this.</p><p></p><p>PS: If you want to take out some of the smoothness and animation-like style add certain artists to the prompt, or real people/combination of people)</p><p></p><p>Disclaimer: The model can generate NSFW content, make sure to apply appropiate filters or add clothes to the prompt ;)</p><p></p><p>Have fun!</p>
