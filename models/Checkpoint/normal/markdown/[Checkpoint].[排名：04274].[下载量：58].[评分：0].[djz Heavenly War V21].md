<ul><li><p>Heavenly War come in three versions. Loyalists, Rebels &amp; All. The datasets is separated, The Rebels are producing more Fire and darker Armor, The Loyalists tend towards lighter Armor and less Fire. All contains both sets. The same Token is used for all, so it is possible to switch the model, without altering your prompt.<br /><br /><br />These "strong style" Models are intended to be merged with each other and any model for Stable Diffusion 2.1</p></li></ul><p>I recommend merging with 0.5 (50/50 blend) then using prompt weighting to control the Aesthetic gradient.</p><p>example merged model prompt with automatic1111:</p><p><strong>(HeavenlyWar:1.2) (yourmodeltoken:0.8)</strong></p><p>if you drop the "djz" and the "V21" what remains is the token you need to call up the concept in the model. All examples shown were the Raw Token, no other words. Tokens are case sensitive and in almost all models it will match the filename.</p><p>It is possible to merge these models with each other using a different value. It is possible to pair models and then merge those resulting models. In this way we can blend abstract concepts together and then weight the tokens to achieve the result we may wish to create. Of course to eliminate all those tokens, you can simply train a new custom model from the outputs, which means you are back to a single token.</p><p>A video explanation will follow, but for now the above explanation should do. We are focused on getting as many style/aesthetic models into artist hands to enhance the creativity already at their finger tips.</p><p>Art Freedom for all!!</p><p>[all original artwork used for training with <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://twitter.com/MushroomFleet/status/1609633158864961539">full permission from Drift Johnson</a>]</p><p></p>
