### 三、详情
<p>A model trained on 137 images of Neytiri from James Cameron's Avatar (2009). The model was trained for a total of 7000 steps using a constant 1e-6 LR. Trained using DDIM scheduler with captioned images and no class images. Using batch size of 2.<br /><br />Recommended to use AnythingV3 VAE but not neccesary.<br /><br /><strong>Words:</strong><br />You may use emotions such as <code>(angry, sad, mad, happy, crying, worried, curious, lustful grin, etc.)</code><br /><br />For hair control you may do <code>(braided hair, braided ponytail or loose straight hair)</code> You may also use other hairstyle but i haven't experimented much with them. But i've seen some good results with curls and other's.<br /><br />For clothing options there are <code>(tribal lingerie, green stone choker, feather necklace, archery brace, leather bracelet, feathers on hair and loincloth)</code><br />You may use any clothing you want like a red dress or etc. Tho it is suggested for more complex scenes and clothing to use Clip Skip 2. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Example prompt:</strong> <br /><br />Positive: <code>Neytiriblueskinbabe, 1girl, tail, neutral, upper body, purple crop top, neon flower on hair, cinematic angle, bioluminescent forest, (Photorealistic:1.3)</code> <br /><br />Negative: <code>cross-eyed, (three hands, three feet, three arms, three legs, text bubble,no pupils), ((bad anatomy, deformed face)), undefined, incomplete, uncertain, smudge, melt, smear, disproportional, disfigured, deformed, malformed, mutant, monstrous, ugly, gross, disgusting, blurry, poorly drawn, extra limbs, extra fingers, missing limbs, amputee, malformed hands</code> <br /><br /><strong>Usage:</strong> You can either use it on Clip Skip 1 for accurate portraits and body. But if you want NSFW or something more creative than Clip skip 1 i suggest Clip Skip 2-3. <br /><br /><strong>Keyword:</strong> <code>Neytiriblueskinbabe</code> <br /><br /><strong>Upscaling:</strong> I highly suggest to upscale using img2img or high-res fix using 2x or even 2.5x upscale at 0.6 denoise. Recommend 50 steps. This will improve the face, currently if you generate at 512x512 the face might be a bit low quality and weird, that is why i recommend upscaling mainly with high-res fix.<br /><br /><strong>Last minute info:</strong> If you want to make your own Neytiri model i highly support this. <br /><br /><strong>Foreseeable Future:</strong> I plan to make an Avatar 2 model, a Flora and Fauna model, a model of Neytiri, Jake, T'sutey, Mo'at, Eytukan, Grace, etc. all in 1 model soon. For now, Enjoy. <br /><br /><strong>New Info:</strong> I am slowly working on a model to make anyone into an avatar, example, Keanu Reeves into an avatar or even yourself. Still in the experimental phase for now. <br /><br /><strong>NOTE</strong>:<br />This model can produce NSFW content if you so wish but this model was trained for mainly SFW in mind. I am working on V3 as well but i can't say when the next version would be finished.</p>
