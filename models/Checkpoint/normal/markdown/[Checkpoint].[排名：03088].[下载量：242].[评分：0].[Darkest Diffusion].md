So any amount of donations would help me greatly to offset some of the costs!</p><p><strong>Tips and Tricks</strong>I recommend using a UI that supports high-res fix, Img2Img, and negative prompts at the very least. Personally I use the "Automatic1111 WebUI".</p><ul><li><strong>Rescale to a 1024x1024 resolution</strong> using either Img2Img or high-res fix at a 0.5 denoising strength for much better, higher quality results.</li><li><br /></li><li>Use "in the artstyle of dd" as a <strong>negative prompt</strong>, if you want to generate images that are closer to what the standard StableDiffusion model would generate. Be mindful however, that due to the nature of how this model was trained the output generated via this way will still look different from the original vanilla model.</li><li>Use "armor" and "medieval" as <strong>negative prompts</strong> to achieve more modern looking results. No guruantee that it will always work however. At times it may also reduce the output quality.</li><li><br /></li><li>If you notice recurring elements in your outputs, such as every output image having sunglasses in it, make said recurring element a <strong>negative prompt</strong>. No guruantee that it will work.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommended settings</strong></p><p>These are my recommended settings for quick high quality results.

For that I needed a model that can be created using only a small dataset so that testing times and expenses are kept low. Thus I randomly came up with this Darkest Dungeon model, which uses only 14 training images (initally only 11).</p><p>I took the images from google image search as well as <a href="https://en.riotpixels.com/games/darkest-dungeon/" rel="ugc" target="_blank">Riot Pixels</a>. I chose only the most cleanest and highest quality images. I then further edited the images to take out watermarks and texts as well as remove unneccessary noise in the image. I also cropped the images a bit.</p><p>I created many different models to complete my testing and to find the most optimal settings and caption style to create a Darkest Dungeon model with the highest possible quality.</p><p><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai-characters/Darkest-Diffusion-v1.0-Dataset" rel="ugc" target="_blank"><strong>The captioned and edited dataset that I used to train this model with can be found here!</strong></a></p><p>I trained this model using the <a href="https://github.com/victorchall/EveryDream-trainer" rel="ugc" target="_blank">"EverDream" repo</a> with filename captions. I captioned the images using the <a href="https://github.com/Snowad14/BatchPrompter" rel="ugc" target="_blank">BatchPrompter</a>.</p><p>For the training I used the v1-finetune_everydream.yaml file with the following settings:</p><ul><li>Learning rate: 1e-6</li><li>Repeats: 250</li><li>Epochs: 1</li><li>Batch size: 1</li><li>Conditional dropout: 0.05</li><li>Resolution: 512</li></ul><p>For a more in-depth guide on how to actually setup and use the EverDream repo, please look up other tutorials on the web, especially YouTube or Reddit, or visit the <a href="https://discord.gg/uheqxU6sXN" rel="ugc" target="_blank">EverDream Discord</a>!</p><p><strong>License</strong></p><p>This model is open access and available to all, with a modified CreativeML OpenRAIL-M license for <strong>non-commercial use only</strong> further specifying rights and usage.
