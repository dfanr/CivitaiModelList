<p>This is an overtrained model that has contaminated most prompts with cyberpunk content I collected from a tumblr blog I run. I made it  awhile ago and I stepped back from it, but have found new use in merging it with other models, It has multiple keywords listed below. All demo pictures have been made with the base model, but merging it in with others can bring even more coherent results. Be warned though, this model contaminates vanilla prompts heavily.<br /><br />Special thanks to nousr, whose robodiffusion model inspired me to create this.<br /><br /><strong>phanborg</strong> This set was the first to be tested, it is a combination of portraits of cyborgs much like phancyborg and phandroid. The difference between the three is that phanborg uses a combination of images with the face covered and uncovered by machinery, while phancyborg uses only uncovered cyborgs and phandroid only covered cyborgs. The images used in all three are entirely different so that I can play with a diversity of trained features with my keywords.</p><p><strong>phanbrutal</strong> Images I consider a combination of cyberpunk and brutalism.</p><p><strong>phanbw</strong> This one is one of my more experimental keywords, utilising monochrome cyberpunk images I find quite striking in black and white. However apart from sticking to a cyberpunk theme, there is no consistent subject matter and may just end up being a generic monochrome keyword.</p><p><strong>phancircle</strong> another experimental keyword, this keyword utilises a selection of architectural, textural and 3d design images with circles and spheres as a recurring motif. My hope is this keyword will help provide a cyberpunk texture to other prompts with a circular motif.</p><p><strong>phancity</strong> Bleak futuristic cityscapes, but like phanbw this experiment may fail due to being too varied subject matter.</p><p><strong>phanconcrete</strong> concrete, images of architecture with mostly concrete finishes, might be overkill with phanbrutal above, but I like that there will still be nuanced differences to play with.</p><p><strong>phanconsole</strong> A command centre needs buttons to beep and switches to boop, this keyword is all about screens and buttons.</p><p><strong>phancorridor</strong> images of spaceship corridors and facilities to provide a more futuristic interior design.</p><p><strong>phancyborg</strong> phancyborg is an image selection of cyborgs with some or all of a human face uncovered.</p><p><strong>phandraw</strong> a selection focused on drawn cyberpunk artwork with bright neon colors and defined linework</p><p><strong>phandroid</strong> this is where I pay most homage to nousrs robodiffusion, using only cyborgs with their faces concealed or just plain humanoid robots</p><p><strong>phandustrial</strong> futuristic ndustrial imagery of pipes wires and messes of cables.</p><p><strong>phanfashion</strong> trying to get that urbanwear hoodie look but with some variations.</p><p><strong>phanfem</strong> a series of cyberpunk women</p><p><strong>phanglitch</strong> Glitch art I had reblogged on the blog with a cyberpunk feel. Quite colorful.</p><p><strong>phangrunge</strong> Dilapidated dens for the scum of the city. Hopefully will add a good dose of urban decay to your prompt.</p><p><strong>phanlogo</strong> Sleek graphic design, typography and logos.</p><p><strong>phanmachine</strong> Built with unclear subject matter, phanmachine focuses on the details of futuristic shiny machinery in hopes of it coming out as a style or texture that can be applied in prompts.</p><p><strong>phanmecha</strong> The three cyborg keywords are sleek and humanoid, phanmecha focuses more on creating unique robot bodytypes.</p><p><strong>phanmilitary</strong> Future soldiers, man and machine. Likely to attach a gun to your prompt's character.</p><p><strong>phanneon</strong> Bright neon lights taking over the scene, this feature is what annoyed me with a lot of cyberpunk prompts in ai models. Overall I have it pretty isolated to this keyword, if you want those futuristic glowies.</p><p><strong>phanrooms</strong> Totally seperate to the rest of the theming, phanrooms is trained on backrooms and liminal space imagery. Which like cyberpunk is of high visual interest to me, and something the base model can sometimes struggle with.</p><p><strong>phansterile</strong> This is like cyberpunk cleancore, lots of white, very clean, clinical theming.</p><p><strong>phantex</strong> I don't know why latex outfits are cyberpunk but they just are, these images were selected for the accessorising on top of just the latex outfits.</p><p><strong>phanture</strong> Abstract textures that were cyberpunk enough for me to put on my blog.</p>
