### 三、详情
<p>Please share some of your generations! I love to see them.</p><p>(On that note though, imagery depicting sexual violence/abuse will be reported immediately.)</p><p>So, when someone drops a coin in my guitar bag (I'm a busker), with either word or glance, I thank them. Can't see or talk with you guys so I thought a more substantial thanks would be... well, this model. So, thank you, both to those who dropped a coin and those who just enjoy using my model merges.</p><p>Remedy is a merge between Opiate.v1, Lysergic.v2, Narco.v2, Jim Lee (DC Comics / Marvel) Style LoRA, and, Add More Details - Detail Enhancer / Tweaker (细节调整) LoRA. ((Links below))</p><p>Continuing the theme of gratitude, thanks to everyone who worked on the models that made mine possible.</p><p>And thank you to the artists, all of them, without you none of this amazing tech wouldn’t even be possible. We are standing on the shoulders of pretty much the entirety of all human visual expression. The visual creativity of the human soul.</p><p>What a time to be alive.</p><p>(Interesting update on the gratitude theme. One of the images above was automatically flagged and accidentally deleted. After reaching out on Reddit to the Civitai team the matter was resolved in a matter of hours. The experience slapped me in the face with something I feel stupid for overlooking. Thank you to the team at Civitai for taking on the gargantuan task of trying to tame the unruly beast that is this platform. You guys are doing great and in my opinion important work. Thanks for providing a place where I can participate in something that feels both ground breaking and meaningful.)</p><p><span style="color:rgb(193, 194, 197)">All preview images are done without embeddings and with Hires. fix: upscale 2.  Steps 20.
