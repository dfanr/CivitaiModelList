<h1>Easy image quality that has a good context awareness!</h1><p>This model was mixed with the intent of having great image quality, and good context awareness. It will respond to most types prompting styles, wether it be descriptions, lyrics, or simply tags. Masterpiece is not required, none of the images posted have 'masterpiece, best quality', or anything along that line. The image quality is good by default!</p><h3>V1.1 Update summary</h3><p>Much better context awareness, small loss of hand quality.</p><p></p><h2>The continuation of a weird model!</h2><p>Having used alfahentai for lot random art, it was only being held back by it's own confusion at times. This model is built upon the idea to get rid of that confusion and make a confident model. All the images i posted are only using Nerfgun3's <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/56519/negativehand-negative-embedding">Negative Hand</a> embedding. The rest is pure txt2img prompt. No inpainting or other manipulation was done.</p><p>Big shoutout to <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/Cryonicus/models">Cryonicus</a>, I want to believe his model was the missing part my model needed. Make sure to give his model a try too!</p><p></p><h2>What this model is and isn't</h2><p>Unfortunately, getting the art to improve to an incredible standard, it cost the model it's ability to make proper genitalia. Breasts still work though. Again, the model has been merged as much so that it retains it's general knowledge. It does NOT respond well booru specific tags/prompts. It might have recollections of some things you might expect in a lot of booru tagged models. For example <em>Wariza</em> doesn't function. Masterpiece has essentially been removed as tag and is generally not needed at all. For all the images I create, unless I stole someone's prompt, it will not have masterpiece/best quality ever. Honestly, i've tried comparisons and generally doesn't seem to add anything.</p><p>This model shines in it's ability to grasp concepts, context and general cohesion. I've tried various prompting styles on this model and they all seem to work. It works best with natural language and descriptions.</p><h2>Model Usage</h2><p>The model works best on a low CFG, i stick at 5. At 6 you already start getting the first symptoms of burn, at 7 it's really bad, and 8 and above simply seem unusable. The model has a lot of detail it can resolve, so it likes high stepcount, like it's predecessor. With UniPC and cfg 3 or 4 you test prompts with steps as low as 7. Take note, that sometimes your prompt will be interpreted differently if you change the aspect ratio. The unpruned image has a bit better image quality in my experience.</p><p>Sampler: UniPC</p><p>CFG: 5</p><p>Steps: 20-50</p><p>Clip skip: 1</p><p>Upscale: 4x Ultrasharp, denoise 0.5</p><h2>Negative prompt used</h2><p>negative_hand, (low quality:1.3), (worst quality:1.3), (lowres:1.3), (error:1.3), (fault:1.3), (undefined:1.3), (crude:1.3), jagged, spiky, ugly hands, extra arm, extra hand, split arm, missing finger, extra finger, three fingers, four fingers, six fingers, (disfigured:1.3), (unclear:1.3), (indistinct:1.3), merged fingers, (bad anatomy,:1.3) misplaced hand, misplaced foot,, cleavage, sex, nsfw, ecchi, slutty, leotard, (text:1.3), (signature:1.3), (title:1.3)</p><p></p>
