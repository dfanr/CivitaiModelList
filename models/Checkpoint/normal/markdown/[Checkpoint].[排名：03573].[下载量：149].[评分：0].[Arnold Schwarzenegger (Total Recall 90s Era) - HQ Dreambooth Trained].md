<p>High Quality Dreambooth (JP's repo) trained checkpoint of Arnold using HD film stills from the movies "Predator" &amp; "Total Recall".</p><p></p><p>There are a couple LORAs of Arnold on Civitai, but imho for likeness this checkpoint will far out perform the Lora models. I'm going to stick w/ high quality checkpoints for people unless my attempts to extract to Lora are only marginally inferior. It's pretty easy to extract a Lora from these checkpoints on your own using the "Supermerger" extension for A1111. If you do make a Lora from this checkpoint (IE: if it works better w/ your workflow) please just keep it for personal use and don't share it out that way.</p><p></p><p><strong>Use Hi-Res fix with a denoise strength in the .2 range for best results</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Please post any images you created with this model that you enjoy - It's motivating to see people digging models</strong><br /></p><p>Trained locally w/ a 4090 using Joe Penna's Dreambooth repo (requires 24gb VRAM and in my experience out performs the extensions/etc).</p><p></p><p><strong>Regarding the samples</strong>: I like to use controlnet w/ random movie still shots to put a model somewhere in frame or w/o something interesting going on. I'll usually grab some stills from Bing Images, or places like Shotdeck, throw them in a folder, and batch run them w/ either Canny (ending slider set 50 or below), or the Openpose model set a little below 100%. Due to this, some of the sample images won't be reproducible if you use the information Civitai breaks out. Also a few of the sample images have the original filename before I renamed the file to upload here - same exact thing.</p>
