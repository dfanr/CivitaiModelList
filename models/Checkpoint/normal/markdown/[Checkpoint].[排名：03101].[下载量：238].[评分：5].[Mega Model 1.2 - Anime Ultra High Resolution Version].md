<p><strong>If you want to support my efforts donations are gladly accepted for time put in. </strong><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://ko-fi.com/asmrgaming"><strong>https://ko-fi.com/asmrgaming</strong></a><strong> (pays for my electricity, time and just to show appreciation - i had a lot of private messages asking me to provide a way for people to give back but its all voluntary)</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>This was called 1.2 beta, but after user feedback and images it appears is also useful as a sort of ultra high resolution anime model - </strong>it has lost some photorealism, which seems to have gone dormant in the model, instead coming out as a sort of near photo realistic ultra high resolution anime style, so i have renamed the model accordingly.</p><p></p><p>my hope is eventually a model that can do photo realistic and anime seperatley but also meet in the middle based on prompts (as well as pasteal, line drawing and a host of other styles) but this is still a work in progress.</p><p></p><p>Version 1.3 is being gently nudged to have photo realism as well as a few other surprise in it but will be a few days away</p><p></p><p><strong>Mega Model 1.1 with an additional 45 merges or so on top of the 580 of v1.1 </strong>Basically a big mix of civitai models, good bad and ugly all averaged out in an attempt to get a very complex neural model going. this is a 16 fp file and it is still 5.8gb or so. the full version at 32fp is 12.8gb. So for this one its considered a beta version ahead of the next one.</p><p></p><p>Improvements i have attempted to add include isometric 2.5d style stuff for gamedev and simcity type prompts, also added aerial type longer distance models, and orbital (near earth upper atmosphere type views)</p><p></p><p>Openjourney v4 has been slipped in and some improvements in general themes.</p><p></p><p>As usual feedback is appreciated</p>
