<p>+OMNI+</p><p></p><p>Hello thanks for stopping by. This is my first model to be uploaded after months of nonstop learning.</p><p>I hope you enjoy. Here is the Mix contents:</p><ol><li><p>PornVision Final</p></li><li><p>Ultra Azoyva +FruitFusion (added my own trigger)</p></li><li><p>Ultra Azoyva +Colorfusion</p></li><li><p>Ultra Azoyva +FeverDream</p></li><li><p>Ultra Azoyva +DRIPPP</p></li><li><p>Crystal Clear</p></li><li><p>Unreal Engine 5 B2</p></li><li><p>Unity Engine B2</p></li></ol><p>____________________________________________________________________________</p><p><strong>First off, I want to thank all of the original creators of the models used in this merge. You are amazing and helping the community so much by pioneering the space. We are all in this together, and this model wouldn't have been possible without your hard work.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>This model was aimed to deliver a focus on what I love to personally create: surreality, in the areas of photorealism, colorful abstract, sci-fi, 3D, food, and stylized art.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>This model does include NSFW images, but I didn't focus any of the examples on that material as it's not my style. I'm happy to say that hyperfocusing on my style has landed me a dream position, using stable diffusion. I feel very fortunate and want to give back as much as possible. This is my first model, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</strong></p><p><strong>At the moment, I only know how to upload the full version as I am working with the Draw Things app via MacBook Pro. When I find out how to upload the pruned version, I will do so. I really appreciate you taking the time and checking out my mix. I have put so much love, time, and effort into studying SD. I've learned so much since stable it has launched, and I'm so happy to start sharing what I have learned with all of you. Thank you for taking the time and creating something with this model. I really look forward to seeing your amazing art.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>++EASYMODE TIP++</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Copy and paste entire prompt below and Just change what is in “&lt; &gt;“ and the style of your choice aftwards)  Feel free to play with the weights of the three triggers words. ***Fever dream does have 2 more trigger words but I didn’t list them because I don’t personally use them. Feel free to look them up and try them out. I really just wanted this to be as simple as possible for anyone wanting to create with this model. I know trigger words and weights were difficult for me to personally grasp at first. I hope this all helps. I want to thank JimEidomode as he helped lay out his prompt in a way i could understand weights.</strong></p><p></p><p>Mac Users TIP: In Draw things app I actually will copy and paste the following prompt below the trigger when you upload it, and change what is in &lt;&gt;. Saves insane amounts of time and my image quality is more consistent. This is just a tip and not required per say.</p><p></p><p>***I am NOT using any LORA’s on any images. No post processing has been done.</p><p></p><p><strong>My favorite prompt :</strong></p><p>Jaw dropping image of a (sci-fi mothership) gushing with (dripping cake) by (greg rutkowski) style, medium format, fuji superia X-Tra 400, iso 4,000, perfectly octane rendered, pastel color palette, perfect composition, smooth, hard focus, ultra detailed, cinematic, highly detailed, ray traced shadows, 8 k, 1 6 k ,3 2 k, (FRUITFUSION:0.31):(BRTDRPP:0.14):(LIQUID SPLASH:1.2)</p><p></p><p>Weights can be changed according to you preference.</p><p></p><p><strong>Negative Prompt for all photos:</strong></p><p>The first 5 are negative embeddings that can be found on Civit.</p><p></p><p>(neglowres_2400:1.444| (bad_picture_chill_75v:1.33) | (by_bad_artist_neg:1.444) | (easynegative:1.333) | (bad_prompt_version2:1.3333) | 3D | CARTOON | BENT FORKS |(NSFW:1.3) | (OVER_CONTRAST:1.333) </p><p></p><p><strong>Best Samples taken with :</strong></p><p></p><p>Eular A</p><p>768x768</p><p>Steps:20</p><p>Guidance:7</p><p>Clip Skip:1</p><p></p><p>Base Vae was used i think.. or no Vae.
