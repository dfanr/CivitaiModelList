### 三、详情
<p>Hi, I’m a product and car designer, and I’m so excited to test with AI, I think is a good tool for designing. This tool is so useful for the design process (shapes-ideas generation), but more than that it helps so much to refine aesthetically. For enhance my trained models, I have also to mix and create different kinds of models, so I will publish some of these that I'm trying to collect. If you want to support my work and help me to upload more models (with better quality), you can do it by entering here and donating, I would greatly appreciate it:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://ko-fi.com/eddiemauro">https://ko-fi.com/eddiemauro</a></p><p></p><p><strong>FRESH DRAW (anime-manga eddiemauro-mix):</strong> Is a good model for art-drawing (2D) representation. It has vivid color mostly, but you can control it with prompt. It is good to adapt to different Lora drawing styles. Likewise, it has a little influence from my "Fresh Mix Series" models :</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/82345/fresh-magic-digital-illustration-eddiemauro-mix">https://civitai.com/models/82345/fresh-magic-digital-illustration-eddiemauro-mix</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/63149/freshphoto-realism-eddiemauro-mix">https://civitai.com/models/63149/freshphoto-realism-eddiemauro-mix</a></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Recommendations: (FOLLOW THESE TO GET GOOD RESULTS)</strong></p><ol><li><p>Put in the first part of the prompt: <strong>"Illustration of", "Drawing of" or "Sketching of"</strong>, to put more art style into the image. Sometimes work so well, but others not, depending also on the Lora that is used.</p></li><li><p>This model is not recommended for kids, and also whole CIVITAI. Try to put in Negative prompt: "((NSFW)), Cleavage, Pubic Hair, Nudity, Naked, Au naturel, Watermark, Text, censored".<strong> If you don't want to see something that you "don't want" to see, just don't use this model, and even that, don't visit civitai. </strong>After so many tests, I consider that this model has a normal level of NSFW content, taking in account that this is a mix.</p></li><li><p>It works from 512, but is also good with larger image sizes, from 768 and up. The 512 is much more creative at times, but it's not the rule. <strong>If you want to enhance the quality of the image, you have to pass it into img2img, increase the size x1,5 or x2 and use Add_detail Lora, denoise from 0.4-0,7.</strong></p></li><li><p>Clip Skip 2. Go to settings-Stable Diffusion-Clip Skip, and put “2”. I trained model with this option.</p></li><li><p>Use DPM++ SDE Karras for more detail. Less detail: Euler a.</p></li><li><p>Use <strong>EasyNegative</strong> Embedding, it is mandatory. Use other embeddings like badpromptversion2 (enhance hands), FastNegativeEmbedding (enhance face and overall image). Download and install it.</p></li><li><p>Use high Sampling Steps, to generate better quality. Steps 30-50. The more steps, the image has more quality, 50 or more is the same. It is recommended between 40-50.</p></li><li><p>Use loras like <strong>EpiNoise</strong> (increase contrast and add color) and <strong>add_detail,</strong> and test. More than all the second. The add_detail generates much more detail, the results are interesting, it also increases the contrast. Add_detail is a Lora called <strong>Detail Tweaker.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>No need of VAE. But you should test.</strong></p></li><li><p>CFG Scale 7-9. Although, you can experiment. There are times when I notice that the CFG Scale 9 setup with Sample Steps 50 is good. More than 10 with high sampling steps start to fail.</p></li><li><p>The style has vivid colors. Manage prompt to modify it if you like.</p></li><li><p>Hires.fix could be an option to enhance the image.Use img2img method, but before <strong>generate small images from 512 (one side) txt2img, then select the image, pass to img2img, </strong>increasing the size of the image (x1.5 or x2). <strong>Do not use "Restore Faces". Then Increase size with ControlNet Tile and "Ultimate SD upscale" with 4x-UltraSharp, 4xNMKD-SIAX_200k or 4xUniscaleV2-Moderate with double of size and and denoise of 0.3-0.5.</strong></p></li><li><p>Use <strong>4xNMKD-SIAX_200k or 4xUniscaleV2-Moderate</strong> model for Upscaling that is better than <strong>4x-UltraSharp</strong> for detailing, but UltraSharp is better for general use.</p></li><li><p>You can use Hires.fix to enhance eyes and details with <strong>4x-UltraSharp,</strong> <strong>4xNMKD-SIAX_200k or 4xUniscaleV2-Moderate </strong>models and 0.6 denoise. In most of the cases, it enhances faces.</p></li></ol><p><br /><br /><strong>Example Prompt:</strong></p><p><strong>Positive prompt:</strong> <em>[description here, example: "</em><strong><em>Illustration of</em></strong><em> a man holding a sword ...] then you can add whatever you want</em></p><p></p><p><em>- then -</em></p><p></p><p>8k, ((masterpiece)), artstation, highly detailed, sharp focus</p><p></p><p><strong>Negative prompt: </strong>EasyNegative, badpromptversion2, FastNegativeEmbedding</p><ul><li><p>Steps, from 30-40 (Use DPM++SDE Karras or EulerA)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>CFG scale: 7-9.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Note:</p><ul><li><p>"Tebakeper" Lora is my face (-.-), so you can use your trained face with this model and it adapts good.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>You can follow me on my social networks.
