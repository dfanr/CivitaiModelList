<p><s>I'm no naming genius.</s></p><p>Photoreal is just marketing bs, but yeah, the texture is pretty good. I know it's an oversaturated model type, but hopefully this one has some qualities you'll enjoy.</p><p>The product of haphazard experimental alchemy with Supermerger, the outcome was a lot better than I expected. The goals going in pretty much came through, sheer blind luck. It's a similar premise to Ares Mix's idea of using an anime core to expand pose repertoire; as well as the dramatic dark lighting capacity from Experience.</p><p></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/5952/experience">Experience Realistic</a> / <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/6931/ares-mix">Ares Mix</a> / <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/4823/deliberate">Deliberate</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/5935/liberty">Liberty</a> / <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/2661/uber-realistic-porn-merge-urpm">URPM</a> / <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/4201/realistic-vision-v20">Realistic Vision</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/9139/checkpointyesmix">Yesmix</a> / <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/26404/sparkling-nectar">Sparkling Nectar</a> / <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/8281/perfect-world">Perfect World</a></p><p></p><p>I highly recommend <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/36070/negative-embedding-for-realistic-vision-v20">this negative embedding</a>. It has an <strong>extremely powerful</strong> effect on outputs, see the examples. From what I've seen it usually kills the ability to have dark images unless you use [x:n.n] to keep it off for a certain number of steps, which allows the model to set the scene. And it loves freckles, so be sure to neg that out if needed.</p><p>I initially didn't think this needed a VAE, most the example images don't have one active. The blonde lady and embedding on/off compares do. It's pretty acceptable without, but use the good ol' <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse-original/blob/main/vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned.safetensors">vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned</a> to kick it up a notch.</p><p></p><p>I'll be adding the intermediate constituents of the mix to this post at some point, you can pop them through Supermerger to play with them or whatever. Mainly I just need to rescue some disk space.</p><p>If the anime model looks interesting, it'll be up soon. I was going to stick it here but maybe it's worth its own post.</p>
