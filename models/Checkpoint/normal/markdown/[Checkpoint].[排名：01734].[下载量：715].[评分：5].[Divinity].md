<ul><li><p><strong>Use with Loras/Hypernetworks/Textual Inversions</strong></p></li></ul><p></p><p>You will find that Divinity can get some incredible outputs when paired with the above. I highly, highly recommend trying this model out with something like sadxzero's SXZ Bloom Hypernetwork to start:</p><p></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/4845/sxz-bloom">https://civitai.com/models/4845/sxz-bloom</a></p><p></p><p>I also 100% recommend trying out LuisaP's Loras which are absolutely incredible as well! <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/user/luisa_pinguin">https://civitai.com/user/luisa_pinguin</a></p><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>The What &amp; Why</strong><br /><br />This model's size is a big one coming in at 7.17gbs. (I know, I'm sorry, lol)</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Divinity does best with booru tags though you can absolutely experiment and mix up typical prompt tags to see what you get out of this model. I usually use this model for semi-realistic images and close-ups/portraits. This model is absolutely wonderful if you want to go for landscapes and scenery with that concept art vibe to it.<br /><br />The model does pure anime and it does it very well as it will be the default output style you will get if you don't get specific with your prompting. NSFW was not in my mind at all though but if you want that kind of thing feel free to try and show off your images.</p><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Prompt Stuff?</strong></p></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p><strong><em>"((best quality)), ((masterpiece)), ((realistic)),"</em></strong></p><p></p><p>This basic starter prompt is going to be your absolute BEST FRIEND when using Divinity and the generations you get will hopefully satisfy you. Pair that alongside good prompting skills and anything else you can take advantage of will do you wonders in my honest opinion.</p><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>VAE?</strong></p></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>There is a VAE already baked into the model so there is no need to worry about needing one, I promise.</p><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Highres Fix Will Serve You Well</strong></p></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>I absolutely advise using the highres fix on AUTOMATIC1111's repo to also aid in maximizing the potential quality of your images. You can also play around with SD Upscale as well after you're finished, your choice. Every image shown here uses the highres fix at 1.5x base resolution.</p><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Negative Prompt?</strong></p></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p><strong>"(low quality, worst quality:1.4), (watermark), (bad_prompt_version2:0.8)"</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>You don't really need to do a 200 token to 300 token negative prompt unless for some reason you want to, to each their own. I recommend trying out Nerfgun3's Textual Inversion which helps weed out some bad generations, particularly on the hands. <br /><br /><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Nerfgun3/bad_prompt">https://huggingface.co/datasets/Nerfgun3/bad_prompt</a></p><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>The Wrap Up</strong></p></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Hopefully you guys and gals out there will enjoy Divinity, if you need any tips or suggestions or just want to chat feel free to contact me on Discord.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Immobilis Dignitas#8258</strong></p>
