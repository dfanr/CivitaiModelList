<h2 id="heading-955">NOTICE: As the rules are far too unclear and open to interpretation I will not be uploading or updating my content here any longer. While the mods have been wonderful in working with me on getting my stuff approved, it is too difficult and time consuming to meet their requirements on a consistent basis being that they clearly have a different perspective than I do in what is considered sexualization or suggestive imagery coupled with them being so busy and therefore taking so much time to respond to inquiries.</h2><h2 id="heading-956"></h2><h2 id="heading-957">I never have and never will produce any models or images that are intended to be NSFW or even anywhere near borderline and I do not approve of using my models for such purposes. I understand that Western culture is prone to seeing the worst in things, as is the internet, but I have acted entirely in good faith. You may find my models on <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://huggingface.co/Miyuutsu">HuggingFace</a>. In the future if there was better means to determine whether or not what I am uploading is considered rule breaking rather than having to guess in the dark and message moderators while waiting for a reply due to poor descriptions of violations I will contemplate returning.</h2>
