### 三、详情
<p>Added a 3d rendering model to wonton colorbox enhanced. cannot link the url due to site settings currently against spam settings i have submitted it for whitelisting</p><p></p><p>In the meantime u can look up the username @ashen_sensored in the search bar to see his model. Which in itself is a merge of wonton by @<strong>Jemnite</strong></p><p><strong>This model is completley seperate from the mega merge series of models, i just merged it and it is a great anime 2.5d / 3d outcome so might be useful for other creators and model merges to make use of it. - </strong>it has also been already rolled into 1.6 mega merge as well</p><p></p><p>Basically i did this one because the wonton models to date have been amazing, the english speaking audience seems to ignore them but they have been great in model merge and just on their own</p><p></p><p><strong>If you want to support my efforts donations are gladly accepted for time put in. </strong><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://ko-fi.com/asmrgaming"><strong>https://ko-fi.com/asmrgaming</strong></a><strong> (pays for my electricity, time and maybe an upgrade to my PC to enhance my efforts with stable diffusion models - i had a lot of private messages asking me to provide a way for people to give back but its all voluntary)</strong></p><p></p><p></p>
