<p><strong>If you want to support my efforts donations are gladly accepted for time put in. </strong><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://ko-fi.com/asmrgaming"><strong>https://ko-fi.com/asmrgaming</strong></a><strong> (pays for my electricity, time and maybe an upgrade to my PC to enhance my efforts with stable diffusion models - i had a lot of private messages asking me to provide a way for people to give back but its all voluntary)</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>About 800 merges at this point using easy Diffusion UI program</strong></p><p></p><p>Ok to users of automatic1111 who are having issues, please go into your models folder, if your model name is 1.5megamodel.safetensor then take the v1-inference.yaml file, create a copy of the yaml file, rename it to 1.5megamodel.yaml. So u will have 1.5megamodel.safetensor and a 1.5megamodel.yaml file in that same folder and then the model should work fine but it must have that modified yaml file in the same folder.<strong> Im also now uploading a config file , download that and place it in the same folder as your model, make sure the model safetensor and the yaml file names match each other and let me know if its working</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>This is 1.5 oil/canvas painting with a high resolution, this release is targetted at a niche art style.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>It does landscapes, buildings, cars, beach and wilderness scenes, it is near photo realistic but with the oil/canvas painting tinge to it. So not full photo realism.</strong></p><p><strong>As far as 1.6 and beyond i have some plans but nothing is set in stone, im exploring the possibilities and new ideas with each new release.</strong></p><p></p><p>Credit to all the model makers, merges and the community in general without which this wouldnt be possible. Hope u all enjoy it and feel free to merge it into your own models as well - im interested to see what people do with this</p><p></p><p>My username is u/ollobrains on reddit if u have any questions u can drop me a line there</p>
