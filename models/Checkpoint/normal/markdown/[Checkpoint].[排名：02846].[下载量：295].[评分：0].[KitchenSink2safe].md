This is my goodbye present to the community. =)</p><p>"Everything but the kitchen sink"</p><p>I give you the sink then, a big boy incremental by month merge of every working SD 2.1 768 based model from august until this post. I put the long boring complicated description on how it is blended in the 1.8 version text box, which is archived under my profile.</p><p></p><p>For those up to date with my 1.8 -&gt; this one rolls in all of feb/march until the 20th, into each their own 1.8 &amp; 1.8L, and those sloppy drunks haha were additive blended into each other to make the 2.0! =)<br /><br /><strong>You can skip this mixing info if you want:</strong><br /><strong>IF the setup images are too small, link for full size here! <br /></strong><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/ZeN8G0"><strong>https://www.artstation.com/artwork/ZeN8G0</strong></a><br /><strong>I cannot control how badly this website ruins uploads sorry!!</strong></p><img src="https://imagecache.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/d3bd0bef-80c9-433a-ad78-2ce10e578000/width=525/d3bd0bef-80c9-433a-ad78-2ce10e578000" /><p></p><h3>SETUP NOTES</h3><p></p><p>The PURPLE changes below are to modify the default size from 512 into 768 for 2.1 models so you don't have to change it every time you open SD.</p><p>You do not have to do this if you don't mind =)<br />Don't forget to save your changes!<br /></p><img src="https://imagecache.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/26059248-aa21-4167-7168-3cf3bed91700/width=525/26059248-aa21-4167-7168-3cf3bed91700" /><p></p><p><strong>The WEBUI-USER launcher edits are recommended !!!</strong></p><p><strong>&gt; </strong>Use the LEFT side for regular computers with recent modern video cards to run the 5Gb model flavors in fp32 at max speeds.</p><p><strong>&gt; </strong>Use the RIGHT side for older low vram 8gb or less video cards. This will weak the startup to use all fp16 top to bottom when it can. (see below)</p><p></p><p><strong>** the fp32 vs fp16 argument **</strong></p><p>There is none. Just empty air talk. I put a grid in the samples to prove it. you can test yourselves on both versions. It's math in the end. =)</p><p>So why is this even an issue? Honestly? Because early video card manufacturers lied. Mhmm. Older cards might actually do real or fake fp16 for math (it's really a crippled fp32 chip doing 32/2 math...heh)<br />This was only discovered when you go plug in math for something recent like ai, using the chip for alt purposes than video games, and it bugs out... but the 32 math works... wait what? that came later..how.. people did checks. yelling. yada yada. that's the real story why we have a f16 mess. Not knowing if you have a crippled older card as there is NO way to verify as far as I researched...the --precision autocast in the above is the safest detour. (this forces fp16)</p><p></p><p>For you? At home? No difference on modern cards. Older 8GB cards? I suggest the fp16 to give plenty of overhead when doing larger images. I used a dinosaur GTX1070 8gb for everything here. you can see at 1200 rez it maxes the card in the details under the prompt =)</p><img src="https://imagecache.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/ae41b539-8639-4c85-dd6c-0de67a1c7000/width=525/ae41b539-8639-4c85-dd6c-0de67a1c7000" /><p></p><h3><br />legality / copyright</h3><p></p><p><strong>Do whatever you want. It's all nonsense.</strong></p><p>All models were based on the laion-400 dataset which is a German grey area scrape to begin with. SD, MJ, the lot. So at a root if you are not litigating vs them - you are already failing as everything is based on it top to bottom. <br /><br />In my non lawyer, logical opinion - it's not my 5gb or her 5gb model... it's the laion400 vs anything in court as it's the daddy. Other people can have their opinions this is just my way of looking at it logically. I can't claim copyright on anything that was in a scrape of the internet for 10+ years in public domain. You just can't naturally by polling the data, so the ai combining it through a straw is no different - You still slurped from a giant grey area pool of data. I just can't see how anyone on either side can waste time on this without pulling in the original company to the fight.<br /><br />So do whatever you want as I'm almost positive that will never happen as it's zee germans that made the L400 scrape, which happens to be physically hosted on massive multi-petabyte server in east germany, and billion dollar tech companies used it as their base too. cough cough. yeah.<br /><br />The Germans made the scrape - other humans split it into a million personal unique models spread across the internet - I put it all back together again. Nothing more, nothing less. <br /><br />Enjoy the model responsibly !<br /></p><p><strong>/ End</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />Personal notes<br /><br />Everyone is capable of doing as they please, including walking away. That is the choice I'm making. I do not like the direction people are dragging and flooding all the ai resources with their nonsense, disgusting and quite frankly illegal material. I just don't want Hanson kicking in my door by association because I visited a site for another model. If you remove the nsfw filter and browse this site raw, you will see exactly what I mean. Nobody is saying anything, reporting or taking action to clean anything up. The adult in me is disgusted.</p><p></p><p>So I'm out! Was fun while it lasted. =) <br /><br />Links under my profile to reach me for special requests, media, or for private offline Ai r&amp;d work.<br />Coffee link is there too if you want to help me destress with a brew.<br /><br />BarQ!<br /></p>
