<p>Note: The trigger word might not be needed<br />Note: you need to download the Yaml file to use<br /></p><p>Introducing the Synthetic Cmodel<br />Why is it synthetic? Because it was trained solely on my own prompts, with just the original images used as Regularization(the next version will do away with that as well).<br />The step up form 2.0 to 2.1 was amazing the model is more flexible and more detailed.<br />Additionally using the negative embeddings by Tolerant Pancake(listed below) help alot as well.<br /><br />Also, As some of you know, I have one of the most popular samdoesart merges out<br /><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/68/samdoesarts-ultmerge￼Not"><u>https://civitai.com/models/68/samdoesarts-ultmerge</u><br />Not</a> only is it “under review” on civitai, people have been reporting my huggingface account, I am worried that the samdoesart drama will get cancel my hugging and maybe even my parteon, right now Ai art is almost a part-time job(i’ve been working with a few companies on prompt related stuff) something that hoping to turn fulltime, losing both accounts would hurt alot.</p><p>I say this to ask for your support<br />My cash app is <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://cash.app/$RahmelJackson"><u>https://cash.app/$RahmelJackson</u></a> anything you can give would help greatly.<br />My pareton is <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.patreon.com/Rahmel"><u>https://www.patreon.com/Rahmel</u></a> which is still up for the time being.<br />Overall, hopefully AI art countines to grow and and the Anti-AI narrative is defeated! Thank for your support and I hope you enjoy the model!</p>
