After discovering the CLIP was off, I reset it and released Gemini 2.1 while keeping 2.0 as well for its different style. For 3.0 the Clip has been solid the whole way through and both of these guides apply to Dark Gemini 3.0 and will give you an understanding on how this model works and its quirks.</p><p>Aside from the more complex or convoluted prompts shown here, the much simpler ones with danbooru tags also work just as well but if you want to create very intricate, detailed and involved images then as long as you develop an understanding with this model. You won't be punished for trying.</p><p></p><p><strong>I'll explain a few things on how this model responds to prompts:</strong></p><p>If your prompt contains a lot of different details that your character is doing.</p><p>Try to first condense it, make it more simple but precise. If your prompt still ends up being very long.</p><p>Then make sure the prompt loops at least once, this will make the AI take another pass to read through it.</p><p>I don't know if repeating the input for the prompt you want the most has any impact,</p><p>but if it does then I don't see there being any other way than going beyond 75 tokens and letting it do a second pass.</p><p>Example style prompts:</p><ul><li><p>Nu-Gothic Art Style</p></li><li><p>Victorian-Gothic Art Style</p></li><li><p>Splash Art Style</p></li><li><p>Anime Art Style</p></li><li><p>Dark Anime Art Style</p></li><li><p>Dark Fantasy Art Style</p></li><li><p>Norse Art Style</p></li></ul><p>V3</p><ul><li><p>Disaster Art</p></li><li><p>Dieselpunk</p></li><li><p>Cyberpunk</p></li><li><p>Gearpunk</p></li><li><p>Clockpunk</p></li><li><p>Apocalypse Art</p></li></ul><p>Art Style can be switched out with Artwork, which can alter the results a tiny bit giving you the same aesthetic but different renders. Art can also be removed from the prompt to create \u201cX Style Infusion\u201d or \u201cX Style Aesthetic\u201d.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>THIS SECTION APPLIES TO 3.0 and 2.1</strong></p><p>In 2.1 after the clip has been reset, many prompts dislike when you place style or design tags at the start of the prompt. It should instead be moved to the final stretch when all art, style, color, design, composition, light, camera etc is written. Since we'll be using weights, the effect of the location of the prompt has less impact than in 2.0.</p><p>If you want to render 2.5d (3d rendered in 2d, one way to accomplish this is to write: \u201cline art, sketch art\u201d in negative prompt.)</p><p><strong>For example:</strong></p><p>To get two characters to fight and actually make contact, actually stab or slash. It helps to add tags such as: <strong><em>full contact, close quarter, stabbed, loses limb, blood gushing, wounded</em></strong>.</p><p>These can be placed sparsely around the entire prompt and experiment with their weights until you get something you want. Of course it also matters how else you write the prompt so I will give you an example and you can trial and error from there!</p><ul><li><p><strong>((extremely detailed:1.22) two lethal swordsmen dueling to the death in the phantom ruins:1.22), (loses limb:1.08), (blood gushing:1.1), (Facing each other:1.06), (Full Contact:1.04), (Stabbed:1.04), (One has short blonde hair and one has long dark red hair:1.20), (each of the two is wearing unique enchanted (ultra detailed:1.22) legendary armor:1.22), (wounded:1.14), high intensity, (swords daggers and magic:1.17), (magic circles:1.10), (2021 anime art style:1.25), (digital illustration:1.20), (digital art:1.20), (splash art style aesthetic:1.15), (dramatic angle:1.15), (masterpiece:1.25), (best quality:1.25), (highres:1.25), 8k, (intricately detailed:1.22), (exquisite line art:1.16)</strong></p></li></ul><p>This is accompanied by a negative prompt modified from the general one I use (which still applies to 2.1.</p><p>Down below is some more information if you want to replicate the image I rendered.</p><p><em>Steps: 30, Sampler: DPM++ 2S a, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 2930654821, Size: 1024x640, Model hash: 49fc1bfcac, Model: Dark_Gemini_v2.1, Clip skip: 2</em></p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>THIS SECTION APPLIES TO 3.0 and 2.0</strong></p><p>Placing one or two style reference tags at the start of the prompt will focus more on achieving that look than it will on your active prompt of your choice. This however happens a lot less when the tags are much simpler.</p><p>For example</p><p>Nu-Gothic Art Style Vs Portrait Of</p><p>Nu-Gothic Art Style or Nu-Gothic Artwork and similar prompts will have a much greater impact on the overall prompt when placed first.</p><p>Rather than in the final composition phase of the prompt. When using Portrait Of, it still won't know what style.</p><p>So don't forget to let it know during the final phase of the prompt, or you might get some strange and very poor results.</p><p>Here's three examples of the prompt layout I used when creating the example images. Replace XCONTENTX with your typical prompt content be it a character, an item, a landscape etc. Then XCOMPOSITIONX are style, design and command prompts that affect how the prompt will look like, beyond what's already written (these three weren't the only ones I used, but should serve as examples to get you started!)</p><ul><li><p><strong>\"(X art style1.30), (X style infusion:1.20), (digital illustration:1.25), XCONTENTX, (digital art:1.20), (X artwork:1.20), XCOMPOSITIONX, (masterpiece:1.35), (best quality:1.35), (highres:1.35), 8k\"</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>\"(X artwork:1.30), (X Aesthetic:1.20), (Concept Art:1.20), XCONTENTX, (digital art:1.20), XCOMPOSITIONX, (masterpiece:1.35), (best quality:1.35), (highres:1.35), (8k ornate octane render live 2.5d:1.31)\"</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>\"((Portrait of:1.38) (Character Description:1.39):1.45), XCONTENTX, (X Style Infusion:1.35), (X Artwork:1.40), (Extremely Fine Line Art:1.20), (Intricately Detailed:1.30), XCOMPOSITIONX, (masterpiece:1.35), (best quality:1.35), (highres:1.35), 8k\"</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>You can also look on some of the images that come with prompt information and use it for testing or as a guide.

It's also been tried and evaluated by a handful of beta testers that are themselves model makers and given the thumbs up to exit beta stage. They tested it for waifus, husbandos, chibis, animals, famous characters (it failed a lot on that, so might need an embedding) as well as it's intended use. Myself and the testers also tried cyberpunk, futurepunk, dieselpunk, steampunk etc with some promising results but as that isn't the primary focus of this model I can make no guarantees to your success.
