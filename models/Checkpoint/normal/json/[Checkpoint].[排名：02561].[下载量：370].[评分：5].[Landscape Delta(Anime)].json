This model is created by me, Celsia, and it is based on <strong>previous models:</strong></p><p><strong>My</strong> Landscape Realistic Pro model(as base)</p><p>Anything V5: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\" href=\"https://civitai.com/models/9409/or-anything-v5ink\">https://civitai.com/models/9409/or-anything-v5ink</a></p><p><strong>And combined with:</strong></p><p>Cloudstyle: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\" href=\"https://civitai.com/models/93792/cloud-style\">https://civitai.com/models/93792/cloud-style</a></p><p>Better Watercolor painting - In the style of Iris Compiet: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\" href=\"https://civitai.com/models/79715/better-watercolor-painting-in-the-style-of-iris-compiet\">https://civitai.com/models/79715/better-watercolor-painting-in-the-style-of-iris-compiet</a></p><h2 id=\"heading-1489\">How to use this model</h2><p>To use this model, you need to have Stable Diffusion installed on your device. You can download it from here: AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui: Stable Diffusion web UI (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\" href=\"http://github.com\">github.com</a>)</p><p>Once you have Stable Diffusion, you can download my model from this page and load it on your device. Then you can start generating images by typing text prompts. For example, \u201ca tropical beach with palm trees\u201d. You can also adjust the parameters of the model to change the quality and diversity of the outputs. For example, you can use upscaler such as Topaz Gigapixel or the Ultra Sharp 4x model to enhance the resolution and sharpness of the images.</p><p>Best step count is around 30~50(too less = simple render, too much = too noisy due to reprocessing).</p><h2 id=\"heading-1490\">Terms and conditions(Policies)</h2><p>I\u2019m happy to share this model with you and I hope you enjoy using it.
