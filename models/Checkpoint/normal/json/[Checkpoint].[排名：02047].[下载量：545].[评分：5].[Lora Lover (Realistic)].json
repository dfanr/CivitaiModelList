In the beginning it was just me trying to get a better photorealistic model, but I ended up finding that it has a special niche that I think it does really well in the realistic category. </p><p>If you are training your own lora of a character, person, or celebrity, this model tends to accept the lora into it very well. The model you train it with matters a bit, but I was able to get better results with this model when using loras trained on a specific person than the other popular realistic models out there. </p><p>It can definitely take a lot of tweaking and fine tuning when using a lora with a model so give it some practice and hopefully you will get some results. </p>", "type": "Checkpoint", "poi": false, "nsfw": false, "allowNoCredit": false, "allowCommercialUse": "None", "allowDerivatives": true, "allowDifferentLicense": true, "stats": {"downloadCount": 545, "favoriteCount": 75, "commentCount": 0, "ratingCount": 2, "rating": 5}, "creator": {"username": "gdumler01956", "image": null}, "tags": ["photorealistic", "base model", "realistic", "lora"], "modelVersions": [{"id": 97490, "modelId": 91478, "name": "v1.0", "createdAt": "2023-06-16T21:08:24.623Z", "updatedAt": "2023-06-17T08:35:00.484Z", "trainedWords": [], "baseModel": "SD 1.5", "earlyAccessTimeFrame": 0, "description": "<p>First Version, probably last.</p>", "stats": {"downloadCount": 545, "ratingCount": 2, "rating": 5}, "files": [{"name": "loraLoverRealistic_v10.safetensors", "id": 67850, "sizeKB": 5539792.453125, "type": "Model", "metadata": {"fp": "fp16", "size": "pruned", "format": "SafeTensor"}, "pickleScanResult": "Success", "pickleScanMessage": "No Pickle imports", "virusScanResult": "Success", "scannedAt": "2023-06-16T23:57:46.685Z", "hashes": {"AutoV1": "1CAA2A02", "AutoV2": "963E72B5E3", "SHA256": "963E72B5E32824AE4D5D5AA47FA1310F0F0C583D1A3F1DBA52FCF5B504EE92DA", "CRC32": "C155F268", "BLAKE3": "89CC029A6E9A274FDFB9ADF055C0C059A97613FBC0582D4ABF78831AB99A4D9C"}, "downloadUrl": "https://civitai.com/api/download/models/97490", "primary": true}], "images": [{"id": 1171124, "url": "https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/d20cabd3-6f52-4055-98c0-90cdbb7559f1/width=450/1171124.jpeg", "nsfw": "None", "width": 768, "height": 1152, "hash": "UKFO}q~W.5X49WM_9uR%N1I:R7WC-pxbahsq", "meta": {"Size": "512x768", "seed": 320795405, "Model": "RealBrain", "steps": 150, "hashes": {"model": "963e72b5e3"}, "prompt": "Intricately detailed Full body, professional photograph, of (seductive glowing female), Instagram photo of, VSCO photo of, Natalie Portman, clothed, standing, on a trail, in dark cloudy forest, toned abs, small breasts, big ass, pretty face, looking at camera, smirk, (fangs), enchantress, victorias secret, angel, runway model, sexy, shallow depth of field, cinematic lighting, high waisted denim jeans, croptop, loose fitting, photographed on a Sony a9 II Mirrorless Camera, (highly detailed:1.2), still image, (soft focus), HDR, 8k resolution, high quality face, super realistic, crisp detail, <lora:Nv2:0.9>", "sampler": "DPM++ SDE Karras", "cfgScale": 7, "resources": [{"hash": "963e72b5e3", "name": "RealBrain", "type": "model"}], "Model hash": "963e72b5e3", "Hires upscale": "1.5", "Hires upscaler": "R-ESRGAN 4x+", "negativePrompt": "(badhandv4:1.3), bad fingers, bad digits, bad eyes, unrealistic eyes, uncanny valley, unrealistic face, blurry face, bad face, blurry hand, blurry fingers, fake face, bad face, bad expression, no emotion, no expression, render", "Denoising strength": "0.45"}}], "downloadUrl": "https://civitai.com/api/download/models/97490"}]}
