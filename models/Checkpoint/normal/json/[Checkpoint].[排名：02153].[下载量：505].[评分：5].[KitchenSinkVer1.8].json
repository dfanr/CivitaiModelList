Just..yeah! unknown! =)</em><br /></p><h2><br />WHAT IT LOVES AND HATES<br /></h2><p><strong>It loves &gt;??&gt;</strong> Flowers certainly so far! (Bloody brilliant!) It also seems to understands a wider artistic range of broad subjects and prompts. only needing light negative prompting is a bonus as well. It also puts an interesting sort of \"oil paint realistic edge\" ?! as it's own artistic style to things.</p><p><strong>It's good at &gt;++&gt;</strong> generally everything really ~ but more artistically than realistic from all the mixing. I randomized prompts from every site to make the gallery here and i find the results better in most cases when VS other general non purposely tuned model. (it seems to listen better)</p><p><strong>It's bad at &gt;--&gt; </strong>For one it lost the face/hands of the realistic models being diluted and has trouble with them in general now. And Secondly, It takes a few tweaks here and there. Meaning you might need to bump the CFG or steps depending on your purpose. Bit of fiddling is required depending on your purpose. Think ..tuning a guitar! see next point.</p><p><strong><u>--&gt;&gt; </u></strong><u>Not a bad point but really good to know: </u>It's also a bit of a handful as larger models generally are, meaning sometimes you just need to run the same prompt a few times as it's got an eclectic mix of seeds deviating from the standard.</p><p><br />I found that you cannot rely on a single result at times as it just hit a \"bad\" seed for your scenario. It's a hugely packed model that has an enormous seed resource pool built in! Making it a handful... completing the irritating loop haha. See the mixing below)</p><p></p><p><strong>Copyright &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> I personally don't give 2 hoots what you do. Know that this has every model from every human that made one in 768+ rez until now mixed in. If it had a yaml it's in here. So, like, you probably gotta kinda sorta maybe follow their rules as it was originally their models. =)<br /><br />** To be clear of what is in this model merge. All working non biased overcooked models in 2.1, with working yaml file, in 768+ resolution, from aug '22 to feb '23 are merged in. (Approx 700GB of models total) - which is why the pruned versions cannot be lowered past the 5GB size. I'm sorry it's as small as I can crush it down without clipping data.
