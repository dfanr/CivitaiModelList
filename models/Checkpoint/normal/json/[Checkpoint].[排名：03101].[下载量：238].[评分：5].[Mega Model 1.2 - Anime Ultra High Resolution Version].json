So for this one its considered a beta version ahead of the next one.</p><p></p><p>Improvements i have attempted to add include isometric 2.5d style stuff for gamedev and simcity type prompts, also added aerial type longer distance models, and orbital (near earth upper atmosphere type views)</p><p></p><p>Openjourney v4 has been slipped in and some improvements in general themes.</p><p></p><p>As usual feedback is appreciated</p>", "type": "Checkpoint", "poi": false, "nsfw": false, "allowNoCredit": true, "allowCommercialUse": "Sell", "allowDerivatives": true, "allowDifferentLicense": true, "stats": {"downloadCount": 238, "favoriteCount": 52, "commentCount": 9, "ratingCount": 3, "rating": 5}, "creator": {"username": "asmrgaming", "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxbiJWLiyZ6ef1qVCOCgp26-tDgyh4WMDo1yfioo=s96-c"}, "tags": ["base model"], "modelVersions": [{"id": 28335, "modelId": 23718, "name": "mega model 1.2 beta", "createdAt": "2023-03-24T10:57:54.617Z", "updatedAt": "2023-05-03T05:41:11.491Z", "trainedWords": [], "baseModel": "SD 1.5", "earlyAccessTimeFrame": 0, "description": "<p><strong>as per description 45 new models added.
