<p>Yes, other people have made ahegao models, but I wasn't satisfied with their flexibility. I decided to try to make an Ahegao face LoRA that wouldn't overpower the rest of the subject. It was VERY DIFFICULT. Over 50 failed attempts later, it's still not perfect. But I'm calling it <em>good enough for now.</em></p><p></p><p>Read below for usage tips. If folks ask, I may add a writeup on the process of making it.</p><p></p><p><strong>Usage</strong>:</p><p>Strength will vary a lot per model and subject. It the model needs more encouragement for men than women. I advise experimenting in this order:</p><p>-Start at full weight with no triggerwords.</p><p>-add "ahegao" to the prompt if you aren't getting an effect</p><p>-change to "ahegao face" if you still aren't getting an effect</p><p>-Adjust weight and CFG scale to taste if you're getting an effect but it's generating distortions/artifacts</p><p></p><p><strong>Tips n' Tricks</strong></p><p>-adding "pleasure" should push it more toward a smile and away from idiotic. Sometimes.</p><p>-"drool" is something it's trained to know, but it can't replicate it well. Try it out, or add it to the negative if you're getting lines coming off tongues.</p><p>-"piercings" may need to be in the negative prompt if it's putting stuff all over people's faces</p><p></p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong></p><p>I trained this on F222, since it's an ingredient in a lot of popular photorealistic nsfw merges. It'll likely have issues with models that don't don't have that in their DNA.</p>
