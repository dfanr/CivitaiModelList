In 1993, he specialized</p><p>in the airbrush art technique, and his career as a pin-up artist took off,</p><p>selling his first artwork to Playboy magazine.</p><p>.</p><p>He first came to public notice as an artist for High Impact's 'Double Impact'</p><p>comic book series (1995-1999), and as a result, Huerta became well-known among</p><p>fans of explicit "Bad Girl" comic book art.</p><p>By 2002, Huerta moved to the United States, where is pin-up art appeared on</p><p>pin-up stickers, famous magazine covers and in many art books.</p><p>He was a well-known guest at Comic-Con and other events, selling original</p><p>artworks and limited edition prints. His reputation as a "Bad Girl" artist</p><p>earned him the nickname "the Dark Lord of Pin-Ups".</p><p>.</p><p>Famous art-comics magazines that carried his cover art were Heavy Metal,</p><p>Airbrush Action, Show, Pain, Skin &amp; Ink, Rebel Rodz, Knockout, Marquis and</p><p>Revolver. He also did many art commissions, which he sold through his website.</p><p>He ranked the erotic artists Hajime Sorayama, Alberto Vargas and</p><p>Olivia De Berardinis as major inspirations for his art style.</p><p>With his incredibly meticulous attention to detail, Armando created some of</p><p>the most beautiful and alluring women Pin-Ups the world has ever seen.</p><p>Since most of his early artworks (including magazine covers) was on the</p><p>extremely explicit side of adult-comics content, these issues were printed in</p><p>very small numbers, usually 2,000 to 5,000 each, which makes them highly</p><p>collectible and sought after for many art fans worldwide.</p><p>His original artworks just keeps going up in prices since his death in 2020.</p><p>.</p><p>..............................................................................</p><p>.</p><p>I used 80 well prepared high-resolution images (some fixed in Photoshop),</p><p>with many body pose positions, clothing styles, some weapons and hair styles.</p><p>Images used are of women over 22 years old, and less than 50 years old.</p><p>.</p><p>The art was trained on the original Stable-Diffusion-1.5-pruned.ckpt checkpoint,</p><p>to 4000 steps, with a batch of 2.</p><p>.</p><p>For Best results use LoRA weight parameters at = 0.8 , 0.9</p><p>You may test other settings while using diferent Checkpoints for a better</p><p>A.i. image render, and for Ai-realistic-Photos or Ai-Artworks.</p><p>As usual, the less weight number , the less it will look like his art style.</p><p>.</p><p>Made using Kohya-ss. Place it in</p><p>"stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\sd-webui-additional-networks\models\lora" folder</p><p>in Automatic1111 WebUI root folder.</p><p>..............................................................................</p><p>The original LORA name is</p><p>arhuerta_v1</p><p>...............................................................................</p><p>Other useful "Special Trigger words" you can use in your prompts...</p><p>... Click on the little (i) icon, when you download and install the LORA into your</p><p>Stable-Diffusion location in the menu.</p><p>In the LORA Menu, it is located on the top-right side of the LORA image.</p><p>It shows all the data and the original "Text Blip-information" used for tagging</p><p>the images. You can then use parts of that text and put them into your</p><p>Prompts, to re-create such art style, or poses, for your Ai-created art.</p><p>.</p><p>Play around with the words for a better A.I. image creation.</p><p>Explain in words in your Prompt for EXACTLY what you want to see.</p><p>...................................................................................................</p><p>........................IMPORTANT NOTE........................................</p><p>.</p><p>This is a N.S.F.W. (Not Safe for Work) Lora ,</p><p>but can also create some S.F.W. images (Safe For Work).</p><p>.</p><p>Known problems - Some times the A.I. adds a little pink color to the lips,</p><p>but the original images were Ai-trained on all black &amp; white artworks.</p><p>The nipples and fingers did not come out too good on my testing images,</p><p>because I was just testing this with Realistic-Vision-checkpoint and I should have</p><p>included another LORA, or T.I., which can fix these</p><p>A.I. rendered "nipple and fingers problems".</p><p>This A.I. still struggles to make perfect fingers, toes and nipples. LOL</p><p>.</p><p>It can also re-create and paint famous faces as Armando Huerta usually painted</p><p>in his art pin-ups. I suggest Realistic-Vision Checkpoint if you want this feature</p><p>included in your Ai-Art, as this particular checkpoint already includes alot of</p><p>known famous faces which was inside the original SD-Ai-brain.</p><p>.</p><p>To MAKE SURE the image renders in a S.F.W. manner, include in</p><p>your "Negative Prompt" the following words....</p><p>((NSFW)), ((Nude)), ((Naked)), ((Vagina)), ((Pussy)), ((Nipples)), ((Ass)) , ((Penis)),</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>To MAKE SURE the image renders in a N.S.F.W. manner, include in</p><p>your "Negative Prompt" the following words....</p><p>((Clothes)), (Clothing), (pants), (bikini), ((bra)), (underwear), (dress),</p><p>..............................................................................</p>
