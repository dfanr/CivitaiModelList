<h1>If this can't bring Spacenoid Independence then i don't know what can...</h1><p></p><h2>General Info</h2><p>This LoRA has been trained using the Anything v4.5 model. It does an awesome job at generating characters that look almost exactly like Haman Karn from the Mobile Suit Gundam series. With right prompting the results are almost stunning as the LoRA is very strong and offers a playground for experimenting with different prompts and styles. It should also have extensive nsfw capabilities as for some reason many of my example pictures already came out as almost nsfw.</p><h2>Usage</h2><p>The model has been trained using Kohya so you probably want to use it in the same way as you use other Kohya models. If you are Using A1111's Webui you want to move the file into the models&gt;Lora directory. It is very important to use the relevant trigger word so that you can get results that look close to mine or even better. This LoRA can be quite hard t work with, but well thought prompts also seem to pay off. It is quite strong, but can be used with a weight of 0.4-1.0 to create satisfactory results.</p>
