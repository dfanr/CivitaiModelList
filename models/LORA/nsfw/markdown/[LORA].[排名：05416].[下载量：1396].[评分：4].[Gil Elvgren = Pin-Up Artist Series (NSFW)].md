<p></p><p>Elvgren was one of the most important pin-up artists of the 20th century</p><p>..............................................................................</p><p><strong>GIL ELVGREN</strong> = <em>Pin-Up Artist Series</em> (NSFW)</p><p>.</p><p>Gil Elvgren (<em>born; Gillette A. Elvgren, 15-03-1914 - died 29-02-1980</em>) was an</p><p>American painter of pin-up girls, advertising and illustration.</p><p>He is considered America’s foremost vintage pin-up artist.</p><p>Throughout his five decade career, Elvgren painted hundreds of pin-ups,</p><p>depictions of attractive women doing everyday tasks, that accidentally</p><p>revealed a glimpse of their legs, sexy stockings, or even panties.</p><p>Elvgren’s pin-up art looked like a wholesome, all-American Norman Rockwell</p><p>painting but caught in the act of being accidentally sexy !</p><p>.</p><p>Elvgren’s pin-up work began in 1937 when he was hired to paint calendar</p><p>pin-ups for the Louis F. Dow publishing company. As his pin-up work found</p><p>success, the U.S. entered the Second World War. Soldiers began to reproduce</p><p>his pin-ups all over their working place and pilots used them as nose art</p><p>on the side of their fighter airplanes and bombers, further popularizing</p><p>both his art and the general interest in pin-up ladies.</p><p>Shortly before the war ended in 1945, Gil moved from the Dow publishing</p><p>company to Brown &amp; Bigelow, another famous company for making calendars.</p><p>There he made more calendar pin-ups as well as other art for advertising</p><p>clients, such as Coca-Cola and General Electric.</p><p>.</p><p>A Gil Elvgren model was seldom portrayed as a femme-fatale, she was usually</p><p>the girl-next-door whose charms were revealed in that fleeting instant when</p><p>taken by surprise.... Did anybody see that ? ... Of course they did !</p><p>Many of his models were famous, or went on to become so, after posing for</p><p>his pin-up art. Myrna Loy, Arlene Dahl, Donna Reed, Barbara Hale, and</p><p>Kim Novak were just a few of Gil's celebrity models.</p><p>In the 1950s and 1960s, it was a great career boost for an aspiring actress or</p><p>starlet to have her likeness painted and published on a million Elvgren calendars.</p><p>.</p><p>Throughout those five decades of painting pin-up art, Elvgren’s art style</p><p>became synonymous with some soft-drink’s advertising, with the artist’s</p><p>pin-up ads appearing in scores of famous magazines and in art displays</p><p>on the sides of buildings. Young women saw his pin-up art in their monthly</p><p>Cosmopolitan magazines, housewives saw his art in Good Housekeeping,</p><p>and adult males saw them in Esquire magazine. His art was everywhere.</p><p>Thanks to Elvgren’s ability to capture youth, beauty and enthusiasm, millions</p><p>of consumers sought out an ice cold Coca-Cola to make them smile.</p><p>.</p><p>Although other pin-up artists such as Alberto Vargas and George Petty had</p><p>both been very popular, their appeal was limited to a specific public.</p><p>Elvgren on the other hand was applauded by both the public and his peers,</p><p>a distinction that neither Vargas nor Petty enjoyed. His ability and</p><p>technique were admired and respected throughout the commercial-art industry.</p><p>.</p><p>The distinguishing mark of Elvgren's pinups compared with those of his</p><p>contemporaries is that the "Elvgren Girl" looked like real people.</p><p>"Elvgren Girls" had personality and zest; they were lively, friendly beauties</p><p>brimming with enthusiasm. They were sweet-faced, but also generously endowed</p><p>by nature. They could easily kindle a twinkle in anyone's eye and often had</p><p>one in their own. For more than thirty years, from the 1940s to the 1960s,</p><p>they epitomized "<strong><em>The All American Girl</em></strong>".</p><p>.</p><p>Some people may not know, but he also did nude paintings of lovely women.</p><p>..............................................................................</p><p>.</p><p>I used 60 well prepared high-resolution images (some fixed in Photoshop),</p><p>with many body pose positions, clothing styles, and hair styles.</p><p>You may discover that many of the images created by your A.I. will have a </p><p>1950s-style "Retro Look", because of the hair styles, clothing and cars as</p><p>were painted in Gil´s Pin-up artworks.</p><p>Images used are of women over 21 years old, and less than 50 years old.</p><p>.</p><p>The art was trained on the original Stable-Diffusion-1.5-pruned.ckpt checkpoint,</p><p>to 3000 steps, with a batch of 2 for training.</p><p>.</p><p>For Best results use LoRA weight parameters at = 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9</p><p>You may test other settings while using different Checkpoints for a better</p><p>A.i. image render, and for Ai-realistic-Photos or Ai-Artworks.</p><p>As usual, the less weight number , the less it will look like his style of art.</p><p>.</p><p>I tested using a mix of different checkpoints, such as ProtogenX34 and</p><p>merged with SamDoesArt_v3, revAnimated, Clarity_v19, which can re-create</p><p>better Gil Elvgren personal style of Pin-up paintings.</p><p>But do try and test other different checkpoints to see what happens.</p><p>.</p><p>This Lora made using Kohya-ss.
