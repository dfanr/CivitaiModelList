<p>Who says getting possessed by your past incarnation can't fix your shitty personality? Here's Saori Kido a spoiled bitch turned ok-ish waifu after suffering a case of past life awakening. Though i am sure some enjoy being ridden like Jabu of Unicorn :P</p><p>V2:</p><p>Well, people always seems to complain V1 was a bit over baked, it is even part of a how to <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/articles/222/rebasing-your-lora-to-have-recommended-weight-10">rebase your lora</a> tutorial to tweak the weights. :P So here's a retrained version.</p><p></p><p>Had good results with: &lt;lora:Kido_SaoriV3:0.7&gt;, Kido_Saori,</p><p>Decided to split her outfit for a bit extra control, her outfit tags are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>saori_sleeveless_white_dress</strong> (common sleeveless version of he dress)</p></li><li><p><strong>saori_accessories</strong> (includes her hair accessory, her armlet, her jewel necklace and her golden bustier, it will probably mix and match at random so explicitly tag the parts if you want to force them to appear. )</p></li><li><p><strong>staff_Nikke</strong> (made some effort to train it as a quasi autonomous trigger hopefully it should be reliable)</p></li><li><p><strong>athena_shield</strong> (very few images YMMV)</p></li><li><p><strong>saori_puffy_sleeves_white_dress</strong> (her old style dress, surprisingly few pics but seems to work fine. Adding "pearl necklace" does add her red pearls collar.)</p></li><li><p><strong>athenaCloth_armor</strong> (Also few images but it also seems to be reliable)</p></li></ul><p></p><p>So I gave the dataset another scrub, redid the tagging and retrained it to modern standards... Well whatever passes as the standard this month. V2 was unable to produce her staff reliably so did some extra tweaking and this is actually V3.</p><p>As always the dataset includes the tag summary file so read it if you want to experiment more deeply with the LORA.</p><p></p><p>Note: If you copied the generation data of an image and it said V2, then that one is from the intermediate not published version I mentioned above. I regenerated the images with V3 and they are largely similar. Sorry for the fuck up, there were 3 affected images that have already been replaced.</p><p></p><p>V1:</p><p><s>Anyway... Turned of fine, not great but fine. Her hair seems to drift to pink and her eyes to purple. So add purple_hair, blue_eyes. Her common accessories seems to be under white_dress, staff, armlet and jewelry.</s></p><p><s>I had some nice results with: &lt;lora:Kido_Saori:0.45&gt;, Kido_Saori, big_breasts, purple_hair, blue_eyes, white_dress, staff, armlet, jewelry</s></p><p></p><p></p>
