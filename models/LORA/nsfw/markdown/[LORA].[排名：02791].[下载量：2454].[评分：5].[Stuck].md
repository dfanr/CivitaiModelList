<h3>I have decided to split these LoRAs into separate entities here on CivitAI, in order to keep it clean and enable versioning. Therefore, check the search box for any "Stuck in"/"Stuck on" LoRAs.</h3><p>Currently, I am re-training the stuck in washing machine locon with fewer keywords and more steps (6300) as it was too simplistic in the face area etc, I have removed most identifying features. </p><p>This place will host various LoRAs for generating "stuck chick".<br />Use the CivitAI version buttons over the images above to select which model you want. Only the latest of each is available, but I will try to remark in each "about this version" text or in the general descriptions below what has changed in the latest release(s).<br /></p><ol><li><p>"<strong>Stuck in dog door</strong>" supports women stuck seen from the front and the rear, as well as from outside and inside.</p><p>It should support sexual interaction but it may require lots of trial and error.<br />It has issues, sometimes it will just stick the woman in a door opening and sometimes there's a window over the dog door instead of a wall or a door. It still often works regardless, exclaiming that this woman is indeed "stuck".<br /></p></li><li><p>"<strong>Stuck in washing machine</strong>" is a locon LoRA which supports women stuck either with their head or ass inside a washing machine, completely inside it, or halfway in.<br />This is also a complex lora (actually it is a locon) and I will have to improve on it as soon as possible. It was trained with a dimension of around 200. I am having issues with faces seen outside when they are near the washing machine (I would like feedbacks from you when using various models)<br /><br /><strong>You have to load this LoRA as a lyco</strong> with the lycoris extension in a1111 (which is now included as a built-in extension). Instead of &lt;lora:stuck-in-washing-machine:1&gt; use &lt;lyco:stuck-in-washing-machine:1&gt; to activate it.<br /><br />Using the additional networks extension you will also be able to see which tags a LoRA is trained with, so you can use that for inspiration. I will upload tag lists as soon as i can.</p></li></ol><p></p><p>The next LoRAs will feature women stuck in a car window, window (house), door, ladder, sofa, bed, wall, and under a bed.</p><p></p>
