<p>Lora for sticking a cock in a sock, specifically rubbing penis against leg inside thighhigh. Also works with futa flaccid penis in own thighhigh using "own penis in own thighhigh" (maybe also traps/etc). Futa can be triggered unprompted, this is because of disembodied penis being close to crotch and being converted to futa by SD, not because of futa images in dataset (tried training without them and it didn't help at all), you can add futanari in negative with high (1.4~) weight to prevent most of it.</p><p>Since this deals with legs, expect a lot of the usual leg nonsense, especially since SD is particularly bad with legs going up. The Lora already increases consistency with legs up compared to normal, not much more can be done. There also tends to be extra hands holding up the legs; you can try to prevent this by adding stuff in negative prompt like "holding legs" and "hands on own legs", it'll prevent some but not all.</p><p>If you want pov, lower the weight of the pov tag, otherwise it has too much influence towards vaginal sex. Most images will be pov-ish even without the tag in prompt anyway, so I would recommend not adding it, it doesn't mesh well with the lora.</p>
