<p><em>Proudly exhibiting his newly captured meat shield, just recently strapped on his armor, our monstrous humanoid decides he might as well have some fun along the way...</em></p><p>Trained on Anything v3 - so I guess it will work best with models using booru - style tags.</p><p>Activation words: <u>onarmor,</u> <u>meat shield</u>, <u>fanny packing.</u> I recommend Clip Skip 2.</p><p>"onarmor" was chosen in an attempt, not to weaken "real" tags, but I guess I don't fully understand, how Lora-learning works, so this might have been the wrong approach.</p><p>Depending on the model, you might want to give more weigth to the activation words (onarmor:1.2), (fanny packing:1.2)</p><p></p><p>The lora mostly delivers the pose. To acutally see some action, add some "sex" activities, bodily fluids, and see what SD makes of it...</p><p></p><p>If you happen to use "meat shield" in the prompt and literally stumble across pieces of "meat" in the output, I guess I this is either because I didn't really "get" how activation words work, or that my Lora is incompatible with the used checkpoint/model.</p><p>My first Lora. Grabbed a whole bunch of images from the 'boorus and gave it a go. Next time, I guess, I'll try less pictures, but better quality/curation?</p>
