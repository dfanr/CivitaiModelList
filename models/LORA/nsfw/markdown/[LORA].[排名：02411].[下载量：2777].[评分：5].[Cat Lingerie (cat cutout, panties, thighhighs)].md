<p>Cat lingerie concepts trained on 104 unique images. Does <em>cat cutout</em> and <em>cat ear lingerie</em> very well. <em>cat ear thighhighs</em> was more of an afterthought and wasn't really trained too well, but still sometimes works.</p><p></p><p>When using the trigger words, combine them with the article of clothing + colour you want applied. ie: <em>"cleavage cutout, red bra" </em>or <em>cat ear "panties, black panties".</em> Note that this doesn't always work and you may need to manually edit the colours with inpainting. Apparently <em>cat cutout</em> works on more than just bras although I wasn't initially training it for that purpose. If you're using for it for clothing other than bras, tack on <em>cleavage cutout</em> and <em>cleavage</em>.</p><p></p><p>Because there was so many images of actual cat girls or girls wearing cat ears in the training set, <strong>use a combination of <em>cat ears, cat girl, animal ears, tail, etc in the negative prompt</em></strong><em> </em>if you don't want those features.</p><p></p><p>Seems to work well with character loras and was tested on Anything and AbyssOrangeMix.</p><p></p><p>You can use the sample prompts as a rough guide.</p>
