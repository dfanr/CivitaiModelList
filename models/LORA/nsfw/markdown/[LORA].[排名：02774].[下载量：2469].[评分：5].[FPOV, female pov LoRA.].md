### 三、详情
<h1 id="heading-773">Finally, an alright Hetero FPOV model</h1><h2 id="heading-774"><strong><u>Important:</u></strong></h2><p><strong>All new information regarding new versions of the LoRA are in the "<em>About This Version</em>" tab on the right. Recommend you read that if you're downloading any version other than <u>1.0</u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Also I'm a lazy bastard, the v1.1 LoRA has a different file name than the images shown, refer to the "About this version" for more details on my laziness, sorry about that.</u></strong><br />This is a model I've been working on for a few weeks. I've been trying to look for good FPOV (female POV) models for a while, especially for hetero content (don't worry, there's other types of FPOV as well incl: futa, yuri, solo, masturbation, fingering, etc.). Problem is, there isn't that much hetero, FPOV images out there, so unless you can find some collections of good images out there that are hetero, this is pretty good for now. There's about 550 images in the LoRA. <br /><strong>Here are the tags:</strong></p><ul><li><p>FPOV</p></li><li><p>female pov</p></li></ul><p>You could always try some different tags as well, try hetero if you want hetero. If you want some more creative results, try messing with the CFG scale making it fairly low or fairly high, also try changing the checkpoint. Be creative, experiment. If you get some good results don't be afraid to share :).</p><h3 id="heading-775">Credits:</h3><ul><li><p>It seemed to work best for me with <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/17138/foxyansfw">FoxyalNSFW</a>, but please give me more recommendations for other checkpoints to use with my LoRA. Using inpainting also seems to give some really good results.</p></li><li><p>Liudinglin's <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/9942/abyssorangemix3-aom3">AbyssOrangeMix 3 (AOM3)</a> has been a good model to use with this LoRA. Although, there are some weird artifacts that are also generated when using the model but are pretty small and perfectly fine. Some images I tried to generate came out completely wrong, but those were in the minority and some amazing images can come out of using this. <strong>Highly </strong>recommend using the model.</p></li><li><p>The LoRA was made using a <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/22530/guide-make-your-own-loras-easy-and-free">guide by holostrawberry</a>. You can make your own LoRA using their guides</p></li><li><p>Also, go check out and try these wonderful people's LoRA's, I saw how it could be done using their models. <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/35383?modelVersionId=41612">Model 1 for more futa and sole FPOV stuff</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/54539?modelVersionId=58906">Model 2 for more yuri stuff.</a></p></li><li><p>To see which model you should use check out the V1.1 post images at the bottom where there will be some images between my top 3 checkpoints that I recommend using (for NSFW, idk about SFW if you're trying to use this for that stuff) (also click on the post's name when you click onto the image post as it will bring you to some more info I have with regards to my testing). It will have the names of the models and the images they outputted. The models tested were: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/9942/abyssorangemix3-aom3">AbyssOrangeMix 3 (AOM3)</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/17138/foxyansfw">FoxyalNSFW</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/5706?modelVersionId=41233">AnyHentai</a>. The models were good at different types of images, so check out that post to see which checkpoint would be best for your image generation. <u>What's being tested</u>:</p></li></ul><ol><li><p>Revealing Clothes</p></li><li><p>Revealing Clothes</p></li><li><p>Naked Solo</p></li><li><p>Sex Position (attempted cowgirl, try different settings next time)</p></li><li><p>Masturbation</p></li></ol><p><br />Ask me if you want any further information on anything, I'll <em>try </em>to get back to you to the best of my knowledge, but don't be surprised if I leave this model with no further updates, this is already my third attempt. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated, as well as sharing of images you create here (Follow the TOS though).<br /><br />Lastly, I would rather you use this for your own personal use rather than to sell, but at least tell people how you made this if you are sharing.</p>
