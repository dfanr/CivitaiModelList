<h1><u>BROKEN-ASS PRE-ALPHA</u></h1><p>See 'How To Use' below. Results not guaranteed and may vary widely depending on prompt, model, seed, phase of the moon, and your opinion on skub.</p><p>Do you feel like the <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/9014">original Extra Breasts LoRA</a> skipped a number somewhere? Do you <em>totally recall</em> a number of breasts that is greater than two, but less than four?</p><p>Well then, by popular demand, here's a LoRA designed to bring you back to that life-defining moment in 1990 when a Martian sex worker opened her top and revealed something incredible. (Or alternatively, to help you bring to life the visions sparked by the all-too-brief mentions of Eccentrica Gallumbits in the <em>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy </em>series.)</p><h2>How To Use</h2><p>Does not require any trigger words, although having a female subject and 'breasts' somewhere in the prompt is recommended. Weight at 1.0 is recommended for both anime-styled and realistic gens; works slightly better with NAI/Anything-based models. Trained and tested mostly on images with vertical aspect ratios (2:3 to 8:11) so you're likely to get best results with those.</p><p><strong><u>However:</u> </strong>This thing <em>will not </em>work reliably with any clothing at all, tends to generate uncomfortably <em>textured</em> boobs on subjects with otherwise stylized super-smooth skin, frequently adds or subtracts a breast somewhere, is capable of relatively few angles and poses, and in general is hilariously unreliable.</p><p>But, like the first version of the original EB, once in a while it spits out some real magic.</p><p>I'm releasing this separately from the main EB for two reasons - 1, to prevent confusion about which version to use (this one can't do 4, at least not in the same way the original can), and 2, specifically because this thing is at least as broken as the first version of the original.</p>
