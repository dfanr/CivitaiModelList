### 三、详情
<p>Kardia of Rhodes! A character by the artist Nisetanaka.</p><p>This is a lora trained on 75 hand picked images of Kardia. It was trained exclusively on digital art. It was the first lora model I've trained to train at 768 resolution instead of 512, see notes for why... It was trained on danbooru-style tags, so use those when trying to prompt - I've included the tags in a .txt file in the "Training Images" download below.</p><p>It works pretty well with most ckpts, but I recommend Anything 4.5, I used it for most of the example images.</p><p><strong>NOTES</strong>:</p><p>-Her signature "Three little hearts" under the eye holes of her helmet are quite inconsistent, and you'll likely need to do some img2img or just get lucky in regards to that.</p><p>-In the image set, she was holding a good few weapons, mostly spears and swords, so it can <em>kind</em> of do those, depending on your model of choice.</p><p>-In almost every image trained, her crotch region is exposed. So if you want her to actually wear clothes, you'll need to emphasize pants, or a tabard or something, and maybe lower the weight of the model a good bit.</p><p>-Originally, I trained this at a lower resolution, the standard default one. However it had a really hard time getting her little eye hearts, so I bumped up the resolution. The outcome isn't perfect, so maybe one day I'll come back to this and try to do some big high-res train or something.</p><p></p><p>Example prompt: (See example images, all images should still have their metadata. Just drag the images onto the PNG info tab and import it.)</p>
