<p><strong>A Femboy 'Concept' LoRA. Turns the subject(s) of a generated image into an erect femboy/crossdressing femboy virtually without fail, and creates a strong lean towards:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Visible assholes/gaping assholes 'before' and 'after' sex.</p></li><li><p>Lean-yet-toned body/androgynous body aesthetic.</p></li><li><p>Anal sex with an off-screen partner.</p></li><li><p>Group sex with the femboy subject(s) as the focus.</p></li><li><p>Having the subject(s) wear heels, toeless legwear, chokers, and ball bras.</p></li><li><p>Demure posturing such as a hand on one's chest, and presenting with spread legs.</p></li><li><p>It <strong><em>cannot</em></strong> do flaccid penises or chastity/it has very little training with them.</p></li></ul><h1>Important Use Notes:</h1><ul><li><p><strong><u>You must use the activation word 'femboi' in your prompt</u>, and ideally it'll be the first word</strong> (its strong enough to replace girl/1girl/femboy entirely for labeling a human subject).</p></li><li><p><strong><u>Use EasyNegative in your negatives</u></strong> (<a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/gsdf/EasyNegative">Repository here</a>).</p></li><li><p><strong><u>Highly recommend that you do gens in dimensions between 512x512~640x640, and then use hires fix to upscale+re-gen them</u></strong><u>,</u> as it has far more success making coherent images within these ranges compared to 768 and beyond.</p></li><li><p>This lora should function well at 1.0 strength, especially in simpler prompts, but you can try adjusting it 0.6~1.2 for effect, as well as tweaking the keyword directly (such as femboi:1.1).</p></li><li><p>Adding '<strong>bent over'</strong> or <strong>'from behind'</strong> as 2nd in the prompt with 'femboi' as 1st should consistently generate ass shots/'cocktails'.</p></li><li><p>Use <strong>'open-toe high heels'</strong> or <strong>'wedge sandals/sandals'</strong> rather than high heels, as the lora has been trained to work with open-toe footwear specifically.</p></li><li><p>Adding <strong>'spasm'</strong> near the end of a prompt will cause those 'currently orgasming' lines to appear around the subject(s).</p></li><li><p>Adding <strong>'heart eyes'</strong> will cause accurate heart icons to form around the subject(s), and when used along with 'spasm' they will further increase the chance and accuracy of an anal sex image. 'heart' as a word alone in the prompt will just add the accurate heart icons.</p></li><li><p>Adding <strong>'logo:2'</strong> as a negative to a prompt can <em>augment</em> images. I say augment because it isnt guaranteed to enhance quality and sometimes just changes the image, but it can and may be more effective on images that seem weaker than average with art quality or composition.</p></li><li><p>This lora was trained on <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/4468/counterfeit-v25">CounterfeitV2.5</a>, but can likely offer solid performance on other anime-style models (my comment post near the start of comments on this lora has a quick comparison of various models).</p></li></ul><h3>Recommended Parameters:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Clip Skip: </strong>2</p></li><li><p><strong>Sampler:</strong> DPM++ SDE Karras (other samplers should still work though)</p></li><li><p><strong>Step:</strong> 50 (20~50 can still work, as well as higher)</p></li><li><p><strong>Scale:</strong> 9 or 5 (3.5~12 is a good range)</p></li><li><p><strong>Text Prompt (the tag order affects it):</strong> femboi, masterpiece, best quality, beautiful, fine, delicate, <u>-</u><em><u>You should add more details starting here if needed</u></em><u>-</u> &lt;lora:femboiFull:1&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Negative#1 (in this exact order):</strong> worst quality:2, low quality:2, EasyNegative:1.14</p></li><li><p><strong>Negative#2 (in this exact order): </strong>worst quality, low quality, EasyNegative:1.14</p></li><li><p><strong>Negative#3 (in this exact order):</strong> ((EasyNegative)), worst quality:2, low quality:2</p></li></ul><h3>Hires Fix Parameters:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Upscaler:</strong> R-ESRGAN General WDN 4xV3 or R-ESRGAN 4x+ (you may need to enable them in 'Settings &gt; Upscaling')</p></li><li><p><strong>Upscale by:</strong> x2 if using 512x512~640x640, according to what you can handle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hires steps:</strong> 25~40 (the more you do the cleaner the image will be, but also gradually loses some vibrancy)</p></li><li><p><strong>Denoising Strength:</strong> 0.42 (should keep genitals/hands from spazzing out most of the time. Consider lower to preserve it more, and consider moving the original gen-step amount up or down one to shift things slightly if needed)</p></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Originally this started as a very small and personal attempt at creating a lora to help gen femboys better, that a close friend had encouraged and guided me through doing. Since it ended up becoming something I find to be very useful, I'm sharing it here in hopes that it helps others create amazing femboy art, and/or serves to show what to pursue and not pursue when creating your own femboy lora or model.</p>
