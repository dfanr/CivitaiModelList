### 三、详情
<p>Edit (20230529): I was playing with this LORA and it is sadly showing it's age. though it is only 2 months old it seems an eternity ago. Regardless went and fixed the tagging to make it produce some of Ranma's iconic outfits.</p><p>Here are the new triggers of the outfits:</p><ul><li><p>RanmaRedShirt (normal outfit)</p></li><li><p>RanmaUnderwear (boxers and tanktop should be able to produce her orange tanktop variation)</p></li><li><p>RanmaLeotard (uses both green and pink in the dataset should be able to produce both but it seems to prefer green)</p></li><li><p>RanmaJungleDress (I don't remember where this one comes from just a tropical looking dress)</p></li><li><p>ovadress (her dress and alternative hair from the ova)</p></li></ul><p>Had good results with: RanmaChan, single_braid, large_breasts, &lt;lora:RanmaChan:.7&gt;</p><p>Remember to add twin_braids in the negatives and use the common positive and negative tags and embeddings.</p><p>**************************************************************************************************</p><p>I had already collected the dataset but I was beaten to the <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/26149/ranma-ranma-12-or-lora">punch, so give them a visit too</a>. That Ranma LORA is nice but is a bit softer than i like. Then again this is a NSFW version made mostly with fanart and for gentle-beings of culture.</p><p>It ended up mainly a mixture of Mage, with a few sprinkles of Mogudan and Naruhodou and a boatload of crappy 90s shit. So YMMV.</p><p>Using chinese_clothes seems to give her the dress version of her clothes while using tangzhuang seems to give her pants.</p><p>Using single_braid might be a good idea as the LORA sometimes gives her twin pigtails. Also put red_hair and blue_eyes, as those can drift. I don't think i put too much black and white stuff yet it still happens.</p><p></p><p>Seems to work best from the .35 to .8 range. Best to keep it in the middle so .5 or .55.</p><p></p><p>Had good results with: masterpiece, best_quality, highres, RanmaChan, red_hair, (single_braid), blue_eyes, big_breasts, &lt;lora:RanmaChan:.5&gt;,</p><p></p><p>The typical good prompts seems to help with some of the graininess of the dataset. Then again 90s lowres shit. I tried to do some up scaling to mixed results.</p><p>I added the tag summary to the dataset if you wish to experiment with outfits and "poses".</p><p>Seems a bit overcooked and I might have done something iffy with the triggers by reordering them strangely. Anyway the trigger RanmaChan needs either 1girl or something ranma-ish to properly trigger. I was surprised when the first thing that appeared was a male Ranma looking dude, which i am sure came from the faceless randos + Ranma herself from the sex images in the dataset.</p><p></p><p></p>
