In 1993, he specialized</p><p>in the airbrush art technique, and his career as a pin-up artist took off,</p><p>selling his first artwork to Playboy magazine.</p><p>.</p><p>He first came to public notice as an artist for High Impact's 'Double Impact'</p><p>comic book series (1995-1999), and as a result, Huerta became well-known among</p><p>fans of explicit "Bad Girl" comic book art.</p><p>By 2002, Huerta moved to the United States, where is pin-up art appeared on</p><p>pin-up stickers, famous magazine covers and in many art books.</p><p>He was a well-known guest at Comic-Con and other events, selling original</p><p>artworks and limited edition prints. His reputation as a "Bad Girl" artist</p><p>earned him the nickname "the Dark Lord of Pin-Ups".</p><p>.</p><p>Famous art-comics magazines that carried his cover art were Heavy Metal,</p><p>Airbrush Action, Show, Pain, Skin &amp; Ink, Rebel Rodz, Knockout, Marquis and</p><p>Revolver. He also did many art commissions, which he sold through his website.</p><p>He ranked the erotic artists Hajime Sorayama, Alberto Vargas and</p><p>Olivia De Berardinis as major inspirations for his art style.</p><p>With his incredibly meticulous attention to detail, Armando created some of</p><p>the most beautiful and alluring women Pin-Ups the world has ever seen.</p><p>Since most of his early artworks (including magazine covers) was on the</p><p>extremely explicit side of adult-comics content, these issues were printed in</p><p>very small numbers, usually 2,000 to 5,000 each, which makes them highly</p><p>collectible and sought after for many art fans worldwide.</p><p>His original artworks just keeps going up in prices since his death in 2020.</p><p>.</p><p>..............................................................................</p><p>.</p><p>I used 50 well prepared high-resolution images (some fixed in Photoshop),</p><p>with many body pose positions, clothing styles, and hair styles.</p><p>Images used are of women over 22 years old, and less than 50 years old.</p><p>.</p><p>The art was trained on the original Stable-Diffusion-1.5-pruned.ckpt checkpoint,</p><p>to 2500 steps, with a batch of 2 for better training.</p><p>.</p><p>For Best results use LoRA weight parameters at = 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9</p><p>You may test other settings while using diferent Checkpoints for a better</p><p>A.i. image render, and for Ai-realistic-Photos or Ai-Artworks.</p><p>As usual, the less weight number , the less it will look like his style of art.</p><p>.</p><p>Made using Kohya-ss.
