<p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://ko-fi.com/rvkwi">If you like this and wanna throw over some support, buy me a coffee.</a></p><p>This took way too long. I've had the pose down pretty quick but the feet details gave me so much trouble.</p><p>As you can see from the version number, it's been a looong ride. I decided to release it, it's not quite as good as I'd like but it has come a long way. Will occasionally do body horror still, add too many feet or toes, so it might take a few attempts.</p><p>Best way is to start with a rough description like</p><p><strong>woman lying down &lt;lora:restfeetup55_rvkwi:1&gt;, soles, YOURDETAILS</strong></p><p>There's no single keyword to trigger it, as i had to throw off the text encoder badly all over the place in training (because it kept ruining feet) to give the UNET more time to grasp them better visually.</p><p></p><p>It should be flexible in details you specify and listen to the prompt well overall.</p><p></p><p>I also trained it in a bunch of front camera angles and rotations, try wide vs tall resolutions to get some different looks (more of a side view). Avoided these here as the tall images make for better previews.</p><p></p><p>It's trained on SD1.5, tested in URPM 1.3 and grapefruit v4. Should work in most models that have somewhat of an understanding of anatomy.</p><p>PS: I made a negative embedding for grapefruit while switching between models/testing, it's not needed for this pose to work at all. But it is needed to recreate those preview images 1:1, <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/16811/negative-grapefruit-ti">you can grab it here</a>.</p><p></p>
