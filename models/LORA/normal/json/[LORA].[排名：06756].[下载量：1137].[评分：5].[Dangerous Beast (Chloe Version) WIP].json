{"id": 54530, "name": "Dangerous Beast (Chloe Version) WIP", "description": "<p><strong>This LoRA is still a work in progress, your mileage may vary! Detailed explanation below.</strong></p><p>A variation of the \"dangerous beast\" outfit from Fate/Grand Order originally worn by Chloe von Einzbern in Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya.</p><p>This is a costume LoRA.</p><p>This LoRA is part of a series I'm working on, check out the others here:</p><ul><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\" href=\"https://civitai.com/models/53083/dangerous-beast-miyu-version\">Miyu version</a></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\" href=\"https://civitai.com/models/53875/dangerous-beast-illya-version\">Illya version</a></p><p></p></li></ul><h2>About the v0.6 Release</h2><p>This one gave me a lot of trouble (and still is continuing to do so). <strong>tl;dr: Messes up the belly button a lot and is somewhat overfit to the training data!</strong></p><p><br />I still wanted to publish this preliminary version however, since I have no idea when I'll be able to produce a better version than this. Adding something like \"tattoo\", \"piercing\" and/or \"navel piercing\" to the negative prompt may help.<br />Common issues are the o-ring turning into a piercing, the bellybutton turning out weird or multiple bellybuttons appearing (usually each having their own o-ring).</p><p>One of the most persistent issues is that the model <strong>really </strong>struggles specifically with the area framed by the o-ring (usually the bellybutton), this was worse initially but it got a lot better after I manually removed the stomach tattoo that is usually present in this area in most of the training images (which was a pain to do).</p><p>This variation (despite not being trained all that much) seems to be somewhat overfitted to the dataset, meaning that a lot of the properties that shouldn't be learned (especially style and color of the hair and eyes) may pollute your generated images. This model (and some of the ones I trained on this data afterwards) all trade between consistency of the outfit and generalization of the character features, which is annoying and made selection pretty hard. I've yet to find a \"best of both worlds\" model for this, so this one skews more on the consistency side.</p><p></p><p>My hunch is that this problem requires more samples and more variation among the samples to derive a more generalized and flexible model, so going forward my plan will be to take whatever images I can generate with this that look decent enough and extend my dataset using those. That might however take some time (and motivation), so I don't know how long it'll be until I manage to improve on this.</p>", "type": "LORA", "poi": false, "nsfw": false, "allowNoCredit": true, "allowCommercialUse": "None", "allowDerivatives": true, "allowDifferentLicense": true, "stats": {"downloadCount": 1137, "favoriteCount": 312, "commentCount": 3, "ratingCount": 1, "rating": 5}, "creator": {"username": "pensive_penguin", "image": "https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/7124e0d8-e908-4b11-8396-8be185dcb095/width=96/pensive_penguin.jpeg"}, "tags": ["anime", "clothing", "fate \\(series\\)"], "modelVersions": [{"id": 58899, "modelId": 54530, "name": "v0.6", "createdAt": "2023-04-30T13:18:58.487Z", "updatedAt": "2023-05-02T16:19:13.817Z", "trainedWords": ["chloe beast"], "baseModel": "Other", "earlyAccessTimeFrame": 0, "description": "<p>This is a preliminary version trained on 36 images.
