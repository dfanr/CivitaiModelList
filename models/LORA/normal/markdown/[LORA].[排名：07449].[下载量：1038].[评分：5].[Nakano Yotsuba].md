<p>This LoRa was actually finished before the last one I uploaded but I forgot about it entirely.</p><p>I'm planning on making one that includes all five of them but this will take a while because I'm trying to learn new ways to train and multi LoRas are not the way to go for that because they take a lot longer to finish.</p><p>I only pruned her eye- and haircolor so the Lora is very flexible with outfits and other things like hairstyles. But you also have to tag more to get the default outfit and it's more rng if you want to replicate the outfits she was wearing in the anime. If you don't tag the color of her hair ribbon it will be either black, white or green.</p><p>Keyword is Nakano_Yotsuba but because it's not pruned much you won't actually get her by just typing that in.</p><p>Like always look at the metadata for guidance if you need it.</p><p>You can also visit my pixiv by clicking on the globe symbol under my name but I won't be posting much there right now because im busy making new LoRa and because of that I don't have the time to generate pictures with interesting concepts.</p><p>So do me a favor and generate a lot of pictures in my stead and share them in the comments.</p><p>Like always have fun and thank you for your support.</p>
