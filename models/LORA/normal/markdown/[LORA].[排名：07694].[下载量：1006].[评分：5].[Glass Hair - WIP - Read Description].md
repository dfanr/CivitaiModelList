<p><strong>Trigger Words:</strong></p><p>- Crystal <strong>yellow</strong> hair (replace yellow with <strong>blue, orange, cyan, green, red, purple, rainbow or iridescent</strong>)</p><p>- Crystal shards floating around her</p><p>- Floating sparkles</p><p>-Sparkle hair</p><p>-Glow hair</p><p><strong>Negative Trigger Words:</strong></p><p>-Crystal neck</p><p>-Long neck</p><p>-Earrings</p><p>- Polo neck</p><p>- (Crystal floating:1.5) <strong>if you don't want floating crystals.</strong></p><p><br /><strong>works quite well between 0.4 and 0.8</strong><br /></p><p>Currently I have given myself the task of trying to train things that have given me problems doing in SD and that I know the community would like to have, for example: holding weapons, that weapons do not deform, hair variants (glass, water , leaves), irises, etc...<br /></p><p>This is a hair variant that I wanted to do, it can be combined with the first model that I did <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/8579/iridescent-hair-lora-wip">"Iridescent Hair"</a>. It has many flaws, for example some models do not recognize the crystals, others do.<br /></p><p>I used 75 images at 1 batch and 1 eponch, here I leave a screenshot of the <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://prnt.sc/PEOq8mY9XkiS">"Training Parameters"</a> section if you see something strange, let me know. Before it had a weight of 9mb, now it weighs 70mb. He was trained with different hair color images at 512x512. Each one was named manually, all the images even though they appeared girls, earrings, ties, etc... I named them: "a hair made of red glass" ignoring the gender or what else appeared in the image.<br /></p><p><strong>As always these are WIP models that I will update in the future as I learn, if anyone knows how to improve it, I would appreciate it.</strong></p>
