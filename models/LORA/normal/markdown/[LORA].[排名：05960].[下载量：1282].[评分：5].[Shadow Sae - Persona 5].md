<p><strong>Note: </strong>I had to delete and reupload the submission due to an error. Download from this version instead.</p><p>Finishing my favorite characters from P5, Shadow Sae is complete in her metaverse form! It was trained on animefull_final with 21 images. I like keeping my prompts simple for the first few pictures so that you can see it without a whole bunch of mumbo jumbo. Make your pictures better than mine though!</p><p><strong>What does it do you ask?</strong> Creates Shadow Sae with only the outfit that you find her in when exploring her casino. Obviously you can put whatever you want on her though.</p><p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Trigger word is <em>SSae</em>. The LORA strength best used is between ~0.7 to 1.</p><p><strong>Extra, Extra!:</strong> Should be well trained and usable in most models. Images shown for example.</p><p><strong>Picture Descriptions:</strong></p><p><strong>(Apparently the new gallery feature has changed the ordering and I can't swap them for some reason, so hopefully you can tell which is which.)</strong></p><p>1-2: Her base outfits included in this LORA with AnythingV3.</p><p>3-4: AnythingV3 with schoolgirl outfits.</p><p>5: AnythingV3 but as a playboy bunny.</p><p>6: AnythingV3 with my Tainted Nun Locon.</p><p>7: AnythingV3 with my Bimbo Locon.</p><p>8-9: Pictures of her in AbyssOrangev3.</p><p>10: A picture of her in PerfectWorld.</p><p>11: Apparently my Lora's work pretty well with ChilloutMix too, so added an example as well for that.  I think she looks quite good.</p><p><strong>What's next for this?</strong> Nothing unless someone comments on a missing feature/bug.</p><p><strong>What's next that isn't this?</strong></p><p>More character Loras. (Clara from Iruma-Kun, Miku + Piscalat from Idaten Deities, Kuribayashi Shino from GATE, Rin Sohma from Fruits Basket, Dominique de Sade from Vanitas, Dos from One Punch Man, and Seraphina from Disgaea 5.) And maybe Wilhelm van Astrea, my favorite Re:Zero husbando or a Prinny from Disgaea.</p><p>V2's of some of the previous Loras. Specifically make them more diversely acceptable with other models and LORA's.</p><p>I also have some more quite NSFW LORA's. Specifically, being petrified, being stepped on, brainwashing, corruptedv2, and one that might be too much for me to even upload here &gt;.&lt;.</p><p>Or just give me some random suggestion. That works too.</p>
