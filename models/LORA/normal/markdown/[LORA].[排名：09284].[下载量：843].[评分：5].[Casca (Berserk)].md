<p>Lora model for Casca from Berserk. This one is rather simple and was trained on small number of images. I mostly avoided using manga images because I was going for more generic style and didn't wanted to channel Miura style.</p><p>Most of previews were made with weight 0.9. I still think it's easier to use lower weight, but since this model was faster to train I played around and was hoping to make it work well at weight 1. In the end through it felt like I'm sacrificing accuracy for an easy to change number so I wasn't forcing it.</p><p>Armor outfit - <strong>casca \(berserk\), breastplate, brown gloves, thigh boots, shoulder armor, cape, pelvis curtain</strong></p><p>Dress - <strong>casca \(berserk\), dress, choker, white gloves</strong></p><p>Casual outfit - <strong>casca \(berserk\), capelet, shirt, pants</strong></p><p>I was really only going for the armor outfit, but there have been some singular images in training set with other outfit and it looks like model learned them somewhat ok, maybe except for casual pants which feels mostly random ^_^;</p><p>You might want to put things like <strong>sheath, sword, holding weapon, unsheating</strong> in your negative prompts because this kind of pose was quite common in training set and you can often encounter this happening unprompted.</p><p>You can add <strong>dark skin</strong> or <strong>dark-skinned female</strong> if you're ending up with skin tone that feels too light for you.</p>
