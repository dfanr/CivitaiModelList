<h2>Introduction</h2><p>This is the first LORA I've ever made, so it's far from perfect. I trained it on 85 images of Bacun's art using Anything v4.5 at 512x512.</p><p></p><p>In hindsight, I realise some of the images I included in the training set messed with the results, as they have multiple characters or wrong anatomy. Five of them didn't even get picked up by the Kohya SS gui. I guess that proves quantity doesn't always equate to quality. Also, sometimes it can get pretty close to the referenced illutrations.</p><p></p><h2>Usage:</h2><p>For now, the LORA needs heavy handholding.</p><p>I'd say put the strength at 0.6 - 0.8 (over those values, impurities and other characters will often pop up). If you enable highres, put the Upscale at 1.5 and Denoise at 0.5</p><p>This combines quite well with other character and style LORAs, you can also try using ControlNET.</p><p></p><h2>What's next:</h2><p>I'll try to improve this LORA some more by polishing the training set, then the next LORAs I'll make will be one focused on a specific Niji Journey cartoon style, and one about the character Arezu from Pokemon Legends Arceus.</p><p></p><p>As for why I made this, it was because I wanted to learn this artstyle, so I thought making a LORA based on his art could be a huge help with learning the anatomy. I was gonna keep it private, but changed my mind in the spirit of open source. Also, it would only take a few weeks or months for someone else to do it instead sooo yeah.</p><p></p><h2>Final points:</h2><p>Please, if you make something with this model, credit the original artist (Bacun), as he's a very talented individual. Feel free to polish it, use it in mixes or whatever.</p><p>Feel free to use it locally or on Google Colab.</p><p>Please, do not use it on your generation service without my agreement first (although I obviously can't enforce it).</p><p></p><p>I hope I don't end up regretting posting this, but hey, it was interesting to discover the inner workings of LORA-making. This shows that literally anyone can do this after a couple of hours though.</p><p></p><p>Edit: Removed early access, thought it wasn't necessary in the end.</p>
