<p>I couldn't find any LoRA models that had the specific makeup look I was looking for, in particular "Bimbo makeup", so I've decided to train my own.</p><p>Results seem to happen around 0.5-1.0 weight from what I've played around with.</p><p></p><p>I haven't done extensive testing on it, but from my preliminary testing it seems to have gotten the idea.</p><p>I'm brand new to training LoRA models, and this was the first to actually come out looking alright. My apologies if my inexperience shines through and makes this an actually terrible model. I had a specific use case for this going in, and I'm mainly sharing as a bit of a formality for people that are also looking for something similar.</p><p></p><p>By all means let me know what issues you have with it, but I probably won't be able to fix them unless you yourself have a suggestion on how to do it. I don't really know what I'm doing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ and I'm kinda just throwing things at the wall and seeing what works.</p>
