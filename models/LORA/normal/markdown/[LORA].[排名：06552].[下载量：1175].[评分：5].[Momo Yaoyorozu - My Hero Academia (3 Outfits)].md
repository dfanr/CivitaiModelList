### 三、详情
<p><strong>What does it do you ask? </strong>This gives you Momo Yaoyorozu from My Hero Academia with three different outfits (her combat outfit, her casual outfit, and her cheerleading outfit... The final one doesn't always come out perfect but if I trained it enough to make it perfect, the rest lost flexibility). She's a relatively cool character in the show with definitely one of the most attractive visual looks. Now only if they made her use her ability more creatively &gt;.&lt;.</p><p><strong>How to use it:</strong></p><p>(I use Sampling Method DPM++ SDE Karras and Upscaler R-ESRGAN 4x+ Anime6B).</p><p>0.7 to 1 depending on model/lora/etc.  Sometimes she may lose her hair color when mixing with other style's, if she does just prompt it back or make a few images and some will be good.</p><p><u>Main Triggers</u></p><p><em>MomoY, CasualCL -</em> For her casual/school attire.</p><p><em>MomoY, CombatCL -</em> For her combat/superhero attire.</p><p><em>MomoY, CheerCL -</em> For her cheerleader attire.</p><p>If you want to just have her wear whatever you want, don't use any tags and just the Lora.</p><p>And then whatever else you want!</p><p><strong>Extra, Extra!:</strong> Should be well trained and usable in most models. Images shown for example.</p><p><strong>Picture Descriptions:</strong></p><p>1-3: AnythingV3 with just this Lora and her different outfits.</p><p>4: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Gothic Chick Locon.</p><p>5: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Racer Queen Locon.</p><p>6: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Mind Flayer Mindwipe Locon.</p><p>7: AnythingV3 combo'd with my released Demonify Locon.</p><p>8: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Sat On/Ass Focus Locon</p><p>9: AbyssOrange using just this Lora.</p><p>10: RevAnimated using just this Lora.</p><p>11: MeinaMix using just this Lora.</p><p><strong>How was it trained?</strong></p><p>It was trained on animefull_final with <strong><em>28</em></strong> images with the usual self-pruning and tagging and a wide range of different images. I like keeping my prompts simple for the first few pictures so that you can see it without a whole bunch of mumbo jumbo. Make your pictures better than mine though!</p><p><strong>What's next for this?</strong></p><p>I think it's fine? LMK.</p><p><strong>What's next that isn't this?</strong></p><p>More character Loras. (<strong><em>Rupee </em></strong>from Nikke, <strong><em>Spectre Tenebria</em> </strong>from E7, <strong><em>Zephia</em> </strong>from Fire Emblem Engage, <strong><em>Ivy </em></strong>from Soul Calibur 5, <strong><em>Heine </em></strong>from Combatants Will Be Dispatched, <strong><em>Conqueror Lilias</em></strong> from E7, <strong><em>Evelynn </em></strong>from LoL (both base and All Out version), <strong><em>Tharja</em></strong> from Fire Emblem, <strong><em>Laharl-Chan</em></strong> from Disgaea 5, <strong><em>Miku </em></strong>from Idaten Deities, <strong><em>Kuribayashi Shino</em></strong> from GATE, <strong><em>Rin Sohma</em></strong> from Fruits Basket, <strong><em>Kasumi</em></strong> from P5, <strong><em>Ann</em></strong> from P5, <strong><em>Ikumi Mito</em></strong> from Food Wars, <strong><em>Alice Nakiri</em></strong> from Food Wars, <strong><em>Chika Fujiwara</em></strong> from Kaguya-sama, <strong><em>Lulu</em></strong> from FF10, <strong><em>Lucoa </em></strong>from Dragon Maid, <strong><em>Laharl-chan</em> </strong>from Disgaea, <strong><em>Dominique de Sade</em></strong> from Vanitas, and <strong><em>Dos</em></strong> from One Punch Man.) And maybe <strong><em>Wilhelm van Astrea</em></strong>, my favorite Re:Zero husbando or a<strong><em> Prinny</em></strong> from Disgaea.</p><p>V2's of some of the previous Loras. Specifically make them more diversely acceptable with other models and LORA's.</p><p>I also have some more quite NSFW Locon's. I decided to list them as well, so if people have preferences on which to fix up first let me know. Specifically, <strong><em>Bound Yuri</em> </strong>(two girls tied up, breast to breast and likely kissing), <strong><em>Sultry Succubus Transformation, Tied up with vibrators </em></strong><em>(basically the waifu tied up with vibrators and being overwhelmed with pleasure),</em><strong><em> Beta Censorship</em> </strong>(Automatically censors any images you create to make them BetaSafe), <strong><em>being stepped on</em></strong>, <strong><em>Robotification</em></strong>, <strong><em>Defeated</em></strong> (decently NSFW defeat scenario for the waifu getting abused), <strong><em>Petrified</em> </strong>(I'm unsure if I should bother with this one anymore)<strong><em>, Infection </em></strong>(this one is VERY nsfw, as the waifu is completely infected)<strong><em>, Dominatrix</em> </strong>(waifu becoming a dominatrix)<strong><em>, Tentacles, Pillory, Masked Evil </em></strong>(A mask that possess' the waifu)<strong><em>, Latex Corruption, Combat Drone</em> </strong>(hard to describe but basically making them a mindless sci-fi combat warrior)<strong><em>, JAV Supervillain, Mind Flayer Defeat, Blacked, Hypnotized Harem, Hourglass Figure </em></strong><em>(</em>just to make your waifu curvy),<strong><em> </em></strong>and<strong><em> Holding a Leash.</em></strong></p><p>And, uh, I want to make a few SFW Locon's so I have a <strong><em>Goth Chick, Delinquent </em></strong><em>(The delinquent girls in japanese schools specifically), </em><strong><em>GoodCop/BadCop </em></strong><em>(Locon with outfits for being a good and for being a bad cop)</em><strong><em>, Maid </em></strong><em>(both normal and naughty variants),</em><strong><em> Biker Chick </em></strong><em>(ride a motorcycle and look like you should)</em><strong><em>, Race Queen </em></strong><em>(Chiling sexily on a car)</em>, <strong><em>forest fairy</em></strong>, <strong><em>Anime Officer</em></strong>, <strong><em>barbarian.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Or just give me some random suggestion or priority opinions. That works too.</em></strong></p><p>I've also added a couple of my extreme NSFW preview images to my twitter (<a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://twitter.com/TwoMoreTimes89">https://twitter.com/TwoMoreTimes89</a>). Let me know if you think I should work on them more for a submission here.</p>
