<p>This man needs no introduction. You know him, we love him.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://ko-fi.com/aeonprime">Support me on KO-FI so I can afford more rendertime, thank you :)</a></p><p>Or leave a rating, both would be appreciated.</p><p>And this might just be the best working LoRA I've created so far. The prompts I've tried were just a few minutes of experimentation, and literally 8/10 worked on the first shot.</p><p>It just works.</p><p><strong>The training was done with the kohya LoRA model, so it requires the LoRa extension for Automatic1111 to function.</strong></p><p>The model was trained against RealisticVision 1.3 but produces good results with artEros, hasdX and uberrealisticDreamy as well. Please read the rest of the description for more details.</p><p></p><p>I've used 50 Steps, CFG of 7 and a model strength of 0,9 for all images, the prompts were standard short model photoshoots, see the examples for the actual prompts used for each image.</p><p>One recommendation, try to avoid the word "suit". It was almost impossible to find pictures of this man where he doesn't wear a suit, and so the dataset was heavily biased towards suit pictures. Use the word "armor" or "cosplay" instead to put him in different outfits.</p><p></p>
