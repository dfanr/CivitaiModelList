### 三、详情
<p>A new character LORA, this time with Sae Niijima from P5! It was trained on <strong><em>animefull_final</em></strong> with 23 images. I think this turned out the most flexible of my previous LORA's, as... Well, I've just got better at adjusting all the numbers. This one combines well with other LORA's.  I like keeping my prompts simple so that you can see it without a whole bunch of mumbo jumbo.  Make your pictures better than mine though!</p><p></p><p><strong><em>What does it do you ask? </em></strong>Sae Niijima is ready to be LORA'd. Her patience waiting hours and hours as Joker tells her his story paid off.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>How to use it: </em></strong>Trigger word is <em>SaeP5</em>. I prefer the LORA strength being ~0.8. Additional triggers that should be used are:</p><p><em>P5CL</em>, gives her the more standard P5 outfit very consistently. Don't use it if going for other clothing looks.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>Extra, Extra!: </em></strong>For the pictures below, I use a mix of AnythingV3, YesMix, and AbyssOrange.</p><p></p><p>The first pictures are standard, the following is with a base outfit, one with a LORA from this website. The final two are mixing my own LORA's, namely one that corrupts the waifu and the other that petrifies them (which I'm still fine-tuning for release).</p><p><br /><strong><em>What's next for this? </em></strong>v2 will be based off of feedback, as I had no immediate problems.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>What's next that isn't this?</em></strong></p><p>More character Loras. (Miku + Piscalat from Idaten Deities, Kuribayashi Shino from GATE, Rin Sohma from Fruits Basket, Makoto from P5, and Shadow Sae from P5.)</p><p>V2's of some of the previous Loras.</p><p>I also have some more quite NSFW LORA's that I'm unsure if I should upload. I'll probably upload my brainwashing one, the others... Well.</p><p><em>Or just give me some random suggestion. That works too.</em></p>
