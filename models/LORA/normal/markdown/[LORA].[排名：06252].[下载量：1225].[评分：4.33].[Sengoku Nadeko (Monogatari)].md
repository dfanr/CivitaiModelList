### 三、详情
<p>Lora model for Sengoku Nadeko from Monogatari series. Only tested it on weights 0.7-0.8 but it worked well there.</p><p>I'm quite happy with how nice this worked out because I included many outfits and they seems to all work quite well. The main phrase that you will use is <strong>sengoku nadeko</strong>. For a regular hairstyle do <strong>brown hair, bangs</strong> and for the hairstyle using hairband use <strong>brown hair, hairband. </strong>Model might still include bangs so you can put <strong>bangs </strong>in negative to avoid that.</p><p>For her iconic outdoor outfit use <strong>cabbie hat, jacket, jacket on shoulders, jeans, pink shirt, ribbon, belt pouch</strong>. Pouch is actually often not visible in artworks cause it's more on the back side so you can leave that part out if you don't want it.</p><p>For her casual indoor outfit use <strong>frilled skirt, pink camisole, white thighhighs, cardigan, open cardigan</strong>.</p><p>For her swimsuit just <strong>school swimsuit</strong> is enough.</p><p>And then if you want to make her medusa style replace all hairstyle and outfit words with <strong>white hair, snake hair, albino, red eyes, white dress</strong>. I noticed model still struggles with hair even remotely looking like snakes here so you might want to put more weight on that.</p><p>I know there are even more outfits and hairstyle I could have included but I think this is enough already.</p>
