### 三、详情
<p>It's <strong>Tali'Zorah</strong>, you bosh'tet!</p><p>This is a lora trained on <strong>119</strong> hand picked images of Tali'Zorah from Mass Effect. It was trained mostly on digital art, but there are some 3d renders in there for variety. I know there is already <a rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/20855/talizorah-vas-normandy-mass-effect">another</a> Tali'Zorah lora on this site... But I had already trained this before checking so... Here we are! I have not tested between the two, so it's up in the air which one is <em>better</em>. Feel free to test. It was trained on danbooru-style tags, so use those when trying to prompt - I've included the tags in a .txt file in the "Training Images" download below.</p><p>It works pretty well with most ckpts, but I recommend Anything 4.5 or AOM3A1B, I used them for the example images.</p><p><strong>NOTES</strong>:</p><p>-It actually seems to understand her alien fingers (She only has 3). I did not do much testing on her feet, but it also seems to kind of get them, too.</p><p>-Her weird little skirt(?) thing on her outfit is a bit inconsistent, but otherwise it gets her suit quite well</p><p>-A number of images it was trained on had added "eyes" to her, from behind her helmet. If you add "glowing eyes, purple eyes" to the prompt, you can kind of get them, but they may need to be emphasized a good bit.</p><p></p><p>Example prompt: (See example images, all images should still have their metadata. Just drag the images onto the PNG info tab and import it.)</p>
