<p><span style="color:rgb(34, 139, 230)">Please contact me here on civitAi or on Twitter if you want to provide the LoRa in a generation service.</span></p><p></p><h3 id="heading-19">TLDR (Because I don't care)</h3><p>Use <code>kiki, red hair bow, black robe &lt;lora:kiki_v11:1&gt;</code> in positiv promt.</p><p><em>If you like the LoRa, please feel free to share your generated images here and leave a review (</em><strong><em>or at least a rating</em></strong><em>) ;D</em></p><p></p><h2 id="heading-20">About</h2><p>I had to take another break due to the fact that the latest Kohya upgrades destroyed my training setup (Nan loss after about 1k images and no one has a solution... so I had to go back to an earlier version...). Back to the cool stuff:</p><p>Well, I'm a big fan of Studio Ghibli, and while Kiki's Delivery Service is not my all-time favorite Ghibli film (that's reserved for Totoro and Spirited Away ^^(and I have plans for those two films too :D)), the main character is cute, and that's really all that counts. By the way, this is my first Anime LoRa. I am currently collecting training material for more.</p><p></p><h2 id="heading-21">Training</h2><p>I watched the movie twice... Once for the story and once for the training material ;D I also added Jiji (the black cat) so that every black cat will look a bit more like Jiji. All in all I used 86 images for the training (about 15% are just Jiji images). I also tried to focus a bit on broom riding... while the actual pose works quite well, the broom looks weird or impales the character...</p><p></p><h2 id="heading-22">Usage</h2><p><code>kiki, black robe, red hair bow, black cat, jiji, messenger bag &lt;lora:kiki_v11:1&gt;</code></p><p>I recommend to use a weight between 0.7 and 1.0 depending on the used base checkpoint ^^ If you want kiki ridding a broom I recommend use controlnet and add the broom via inpaint. Maybe I will try to train the model a bit more in that area in the future...</p>
