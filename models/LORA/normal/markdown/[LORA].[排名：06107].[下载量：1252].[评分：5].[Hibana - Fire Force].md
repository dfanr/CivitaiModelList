### 三、详情
<p><strong>V2 uploaded!</strong></p><p>This version should be <strong><em>much, much more compatible</em></strong> with other LORA's and way more checkpoint models that you want to use for her. I've attached images and described the Lora's that I combo'd with, as well as some other model usage that V1 failed at working well with.</p><p></p><p><strong>Pictures:</strong></p><p>1-3: Base Anythingv3 and her normal outfit.</p><p>4: Just adding military outfit.</p><p>5: Using a Naughty Schoolgirl LORA.</p><p>6: Using my corruption LORA on her.</p><p>7: Using made in progress Petrification LORA.</p><p>8: Using my recently completed Bimbofication LORA.  Should be uploaded soonish.</p><p>9-10: Using AbyessOrangev3 to show it works well there now.</p><p>11: Even does decent on PerfectWorld.</p><p></p><p><strong>Additional Trigger:</strong></p><p><em>FFClothes + wearing FFClothes</em> works on improving that she wears her outfit.  Don't include if you want other outfits.</p><p></p><p>-----------------------------v1 Info but still relevant-------------------------</p><p>Was waiting for someone to make a LORA for Hibana from Fire Force but... Just decided to make one myself. Currently uploading my newest version to Civit but tempted to do a little more refining on it (specifically around trying to get the eyes look more like they do in the anime.) . It was trained on AnythingV3 with 44 images. Unsure if I'll have a second version come out for this one, as I think it works well. Let me know for any specific things you may want.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>What does it do you ask? </em></strong>Hibana is fantastic and one of the best characters in Fire Force. And she doesn't get enough attention, so here comes a LORA for her so that maybe she can see a little more lovin'.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>How to use it: </em></strong>Trigger word is HibanaFF. I prefer the LORA strength being ~0.7.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>Extra, Extra!: </em></strong>The final two images were made used making checkpoints that weren't AnythingV3. It works. Though success is more variable.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>What next for this? </em></strong>Maybe update it... Just unsure with what.</p>
