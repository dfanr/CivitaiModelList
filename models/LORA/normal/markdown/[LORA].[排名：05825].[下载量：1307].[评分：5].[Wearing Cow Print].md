All images posted are from this epoch because from plot xy after that it start to give cow print to everything, even the skin, so this model actually gave best result with only 20 steps each image, really rare.</p><p></p><p>i tryied to insert keyword back view but the truth it's that i didn't find enough images in cow print for a back view, so it doesn't work usually, you might try to give an higher weight to back view and hope it works.</p><p></p><p>Advices: </p><p>1. try to move the keyword "wearing cow print" to the top if it doesn't generate cow print, try to give it a weight. In the opposite side, if everything has cow print and you want only the dress move it on the bottom and/or lower the weight on the keyword.</p><p>2. if you want to use keywords lingerie or elegant, try to use them like this "wearing elegant cow print dress" or "wearing cow print lingerie". but remember for the elegant part you need a proper environment in the prompt for a elegant dress, like a gala premier or anything where usually you wear elegant dress, bucause most of the images in the training are lingerie cow print.</p><p>3. you can decide to use other colors then white and black, in that case try to rephrase like "wearing elegant red and white cow print dress".</p><p></p><p>Enjoy!<br /><br /><strong><u>If you'd like to support my efforts and have access to early and bleeding edge builds</u></strong>, please think about joining my Patreon: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.patreon.com/betterCuteAsians"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/betterCuteAsians</strong></a></p>
