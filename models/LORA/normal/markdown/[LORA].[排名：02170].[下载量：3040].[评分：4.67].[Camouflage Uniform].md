And anyway when you use this keyword be prepared to generate a lot of images before finding one that makes sense.</p><p>"military camp" and "in a forest" are just to get an image in the proper environment.</p><p></p><p>Also, as you can see from my images i have generated these uniforms in different colors, in this case, since all training images are black and green you might need to bet in SD creativity for the result and my advice is to give a very high weight to the color, like "(wearing camouflage_uniform:1.3), wearing cap, (holding a rifle:1.5), (red uniform:1.5)"</p><p></p><p>It works also with anime, i used Chillout for realistic one and Yesmix for anime ones.</p><p></p><p>I'm uploading epoch 4 out of 10, the one that gived best results with images with holding a rifle keyword (hardest image to generate).
