<p>Silk von Santana from <strong>Tensei Kizoku no Isekai Boukenroku/The Aristocrat's Otherworldly Adventure</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Expand with <strong>Show More</strong>, long but hopefully worth the read.</p><p></p><p>Slightly overbaked (as I have no idea what I am doing) so use at <strong><em><u>0.7 - 1.0</u></em></strong> strength depending on the model used. No trigger word is needed.</p><p></p><p><strong>Recommended prompt:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>&lt;lora:SilkVonSantana:0.7&gt;, (masterpiece), best quality, intricate details, ultra details, ultra quality, rule of third, detailed face, detailed iris, 1girl, solo, long hair, purple eyes, hair between eyes, purple hair, hair intakes, bangs</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Optional:</strong></p><p></p><p>Use <strong>hair ornament</strong> for the crescent moon thing in her hair, if you don't include in the prompt it will appear randomly in some shots but if you don't want it, putting it in the negative will stop it from showing up.</p><p></p><p>Trained with screenshots of her every appearance in the anime so far using <a rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/23900/anylora-checkpoint">AnyLoRA</a>, so I would recommend using that, though any Anime checkpoint should work fine. All preview images were generated with AnyLoRA.</p><p></p><p>While not needed, I would heavily recommend using <a rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/58390/detail-tweaker-lora-lora">Detail Tweaker LoRA</a> as it is some form of black magic and I rarely generate any images without it. Most of the previews use it.</p><p></p><p>I generate my images relatively big at <strong>600x960</strong> and then <strong>Hires. fix</strong> them by 2.2/2.3 to end up just right for 4K screens but I threw in a few done at <strong>512x512</strong> to show what it can do at lower resolutions too.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This was the first LoRA I ever made, I taught myself how to make LoRA to make it, so it is far from perfect. I only made it as no-one else seemed like they were going to, but now one for Silk has appeared, I thought I might as well put mine up too.</p><p></p><p>I only spent about 30 mins to create this LoRA (10 to take and process the screenshots and 20 to train) so it's bound to be a little rough, but I will likely update when she appears in further episodes.</p><p></p><p>I have a few other LoRA in the same vein and quality as this, so a favourable review or two on this and I'll likely upload those too.</p>
