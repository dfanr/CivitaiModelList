<p><strong><u>Warning: this is an experimental LoRA</u></strong>. The aim is to be able to reproduce the Burberry check plaid pattern and apply it to certain clothes.</p><p>I've been trying out a few things and this is the outcome of one of those. It is not a polished post as I try to do. Basically, I'm trying to see how well can the model learn how to use certain patterns to apply to different objects, and how high can the fidelity of the output be. So far, it has been hard to maintain consistency, so don't take this lora too seriously, and don't expect high reliability and efficacy.</p><p>This one is a bit hit or miss. So generations look great, others it's very hard to get anything out of it. Trigger: <strong><em>burberry plaid</em></strong>. Because this was trained only on photos, <u>I recommend you use the tag </u><strong><em><u>realistic </u></em></strong><u>in the negative prompt if using anime models</u>. If you're using NAI-based semi-realistic models it should also work, but haven't tested yet.</p><p>Most of my images are cherry-picked. Some items of clothes are easier to get the pattern on, like jackets, dresses and shirts. Other items like hats, sneakers, etc. may require more trial and error. See the images for reference.</p><p>Let me know if this is the kind of thing that you'd like to see more of. So far I've been making small experiments since the demand appears to be low. But I've been making a bunch of trials which I haven't released. If there's demand, I can work on more polished versions.</p>
