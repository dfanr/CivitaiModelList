### 三、详情
<p>Yorha commander from the 2023 anime series. Made on request but I'll share it here too in case anyone else needs it.</p><p>There are two versions, pick whichever you want according to the following - 1.0-ALT is more flexible but possible less slightly less accurate (not that the anime style is especially detailed or anything). 1.0 is better at producing the default outfit but a bit more stubborn in displaying other types of clothing.</p><p><strong><u>How to use</u></strong><br />Use the "yorcom" tag and the 1girl, that's usually enough for most models.<br /><strong>Default outfit tags</strong>: white coat, white gloves, white thigh boots, ascot, see-through cleavage<br /><strong>Optional tags</strong>: hair ornament, finely detailed grey eyes (or whatever color you prefer)</p><p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: Using just "yorcom", and negatives "greyscale", "monochrome" on NAI produces screencaps from a futuristic YorHA high school anime with serious yuri undertones for some reason. <br /><br />Recommended strength is anywhere between 0.6 to 1.00 depending on prompt, model and tags.</p><p><strong><u>Notes</u></strong><br />Since the original outfit is all she wears in the anime (so far) it can sometimes bleed through and affect other outfits influencing their style. This is mainly the semi-transparent area in her default outfit since it didn't have a good tag to target it with. If this happens just modify the LoRA or outfit weights. <br />Personally I don't bother since I feel the commander is tight laced enough to totally only wear YorHA logo clothing off duty as well.<br />The logo thing is tagged as "emblem", it's possible to apply sometimes make it appear on it's own, see tattoo image sample.</p><p><strong><u>Misc</u></strong><br />768 resolution trained on NAI without noise offset option for best LoRA compatibility. Dataset based on 17 screencaps from the TV-release first six episodes + two custom image from previous generation output.<br />Tested on NAI + AOM2.</p><p>Don't forget to review and upload your own images, it's always fun to see what you're creating! <br />Like my LoRAs and want more? Please consider a small tip towards my electricity bill and further training &gt;.&lt;</p>
