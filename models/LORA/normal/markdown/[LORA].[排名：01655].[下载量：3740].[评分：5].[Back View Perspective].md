Maybe in the future ill come up with a new version that can handle also this.</p><p>Works with both realistic and anime images.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p></p><p><strong><u>If you'd like to support my efforts and have access to early and bleeding edge builds</u></strong>, please think about joining my Patreon: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.patreon.com/betterCuteAsians"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/betterCuteAsians</strong></a></p>
