<p>This LoRA is based on official art for the <em>Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</em> franchise. I have focused exclusively on the young protagonist, <em>Nanoha</em>, and carefully constructed a training dataset consisting of high quality art and tagging. Over the span of several weeks, I trained and retrained to accurately diffuse a style similar to the official art style. The diffused images should be immediately recognizable for any other collectors of the official <em>Nanoha</em> artworks!</p><p><strong>Tagging</strong></p><p>The activation tag is '<em>takamachi nanoha</em>'. If you want her most recognized appearance, add '<em>twintails</em>' and '<em>white ribbon</em>'. This is the way she is most often depicted. But the training dataset consists of other hair ornaments and hair styles, so feel free to experiment here. For example, try <em>'straight hair</em>' for her nighttime hair or '<em>black ribbon</em>' for <em>Fate's </em>ribbons!</p><p><strong>Strength</strong></p><p>The strength of the LoRA should be anywhere between <em>0.6 </em>and <em>0.8</em>. If you prefer the visual style to match the official art as much as possible, stick with <em>0.8</em>. The trade-off for this is losing some prompting flexibility. Lower the LoRA strength to regain that flexibility! Anything below <em>0.6</em> loses her appearance and the official art style.</p><p><strong>Quality</strong></p><p>Preview images here on <em>civitai </em>are heavily compressed and introduce quite a few JPG compression artifacts. To see the true quality this LoRA can accomplish, generate one of the preview examples locally and upscale with <em>R-ESRGAN 4x+ Anime6B. </em>Or, click here: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://i.imgur.com/SBQoruy.png">https://i.imgur.com/SBQoruy.png</a>.</p><p><strong>Feedback</strong></p><p>I would love to hear your thoughts and see your diffusions!
