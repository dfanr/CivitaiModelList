<p>Cracked skin is another concept which the AI doesn't seem to be able to understand very well, so I have trained a LORA to take care of this.</p><p></p><p>It takes a bit to get it working proficiently using txt2img, but once you've got it down it works like a charm. Does especially well with offset loras/models. After testing for a while, I ended up achieving my best results using all of the trained tags plus an offset lora and the cracked skin lora both set at 0.6.</p><p></p><p>It is capable of both cracked skin and glowing cracked skin. Cracked skin can be achieved simply prompting those words, but for the latter though, I highly advise using an offset lora or prompt weighting "<em>dark skin, colored skin</em>", otherwise you end up struggling to get visible results. You may <strong>possibly</strong> have to use all of the tokens together, but I'm not entirely sure on that. You can also easily inpaint with it, too, which I would recommend over using txt2img if you care about precision.</p><p></p><p>Eventually I want to do a lora for veins as well, but apparently building datasets for this kind of concept is fairly difficult.</p>
