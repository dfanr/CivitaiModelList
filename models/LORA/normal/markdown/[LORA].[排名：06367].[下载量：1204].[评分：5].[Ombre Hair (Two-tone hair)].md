<p>This lora is designed to help create an "ombre" hair effect in which hair fades from one color into another. It's far from perfect, but with a little experimentation I've found it can work really well. It works best with images leaning into a photo/realistic style but I've produced anime type stuff with it as well.</p><p></p><p>This is my second submission and I'm very much still learning - so feedback both positive and negative is greatly appreciated!</p><p></p><p>TIPS FOR USING:</p><ul><li><p>Weight and CFG depend highly on the model you're pairing it with. Usually .5 weight is a good place to start and around a 7 CFG. But I've had a few situations where those numbers were extremely different in order to get a good result.</p></li><li><p>It usually can respond to specific color requests. "Brown to blonde ombre hair" should typically yield results that look roughly right. It struggles with some hair color combos  more than others, so play with weight if you're not getting the desired result. I've found it's strongest with blonde/red combos.</p></li><li><p>Clip skip 2 has usually yielded best results for me</p></li><li><p>It should be able to handle different hair lengths, styles, and textures!</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Example images don't use any inpainting or additional loras. Tried with a variety of Checkpoints to see how it would work.</p>
