<h1>Please read, this is not a plug and play LORA!</h1><p><br />To effectively use this LORA you will need to use (armpit hair:1.3), or (armpit hair:1.4), or (armpit hair:1.5) <strong>and a low weight on the LORA, around 0.3-0.45... GOING HIGHER WILL MAKE BAD IMAGES. </strong><br /><br />As for other quirks: <br /><strong>1.</strong> You pretty much have to use high res fix for the best results, something about it's magic helps alot. <br /><br /><strong>2. </strong>It's pretty much gacha if the armpit hair is in the right spot or size, but it's about 80% accurate. Playing with the weights of the tag and LORA can help though. <br /><br /><strong>3.</strong> This LORA will pretty much force the arms up position. If you are looking for more a hair peek, then you will have to inpaint, which this LORA gives you the ability to do. Simply turn on the LORA, select Only Masked or whole image depending on the situation, use your regular Negative Prompt, and in the positives use: "&lt;color&gt; hair, armpit hair" and boom, you can inpaint armpit hair. The picture of the lady with the green hair (Maho) was made using inpaint <br /><br /><strong>4.</strong> Weird hair colors may be hard to produce, blue, red or purple may take many tries, and you will have to play with the weights of the tag and LORA to get it right. Brown and Black work without much fuss. White doesn't work at all.</p><p><strong>5,<em> </em></strong>This lora has a tendency to make nipples appear through clothing, due to the rather degenerate dataset. If this is not something you want, add "nipples" and "skin tight" to your negatives.</p><p><strong>Have fun!</strong></p>
