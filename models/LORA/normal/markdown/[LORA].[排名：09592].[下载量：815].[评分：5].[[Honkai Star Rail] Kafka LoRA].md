<p>Hey there.</p><p></p><p>None of the images were cherrypicked, all of them were the first or second image that came out of the generations I made.</p><p>recommended settings are:</p><p>sampling method either DPM++ 2M Karras or Euler a. For DPM, I recommend around 30-40 and with Euler a 30 steps.</p><p>Hiresfix: R-ESRGAN 4x+ Anime6B with a hires steps about 10-30</p><p>Denoising strength: 0.5</p><p>and the most important, LoRA strength at 0.7.</p><p>For negative, (worst quality, low quality:1.4)</p><p></p><p>its pretty flexible, but it does have some issues when it comes to wedding dress or school uniform. If you want to have other clothes than her actual one, I recommend putting "collared shirt, black jacket" into negative, and that should fix the problem.</p><p>And yes, it can do hentai too, with OK results. Try describing it as much as you can to get best results with those images.</p><p>EDIT: Forgot to say, that I recommend using "black jacket, black shorts and collared shirt in the prompt to make sure the AI understands that you want the outfit of hers. It made for me without those, but not all the time.</p><p></p><p>EDIT 2: Totally forgot about it. I made it so, that you can remove the glasses too from her head, by just not using the word "eyewear on head". And this way, you obviously have to use "eyewear on head" for it to appear.</p>
