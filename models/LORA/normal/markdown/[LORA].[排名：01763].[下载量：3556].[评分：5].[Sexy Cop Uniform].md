It doesn't work as i expected.</p><p>First advice i give you it's to put a big weight on the keyword, like "(wearing sexy cop uniform:1.5)" and use always the model with atleast a 0.5-0.6 weight or you will see a bikini girl with a cop cap hat.</p><p>You can prompt something like "blue uniform" or "black uniform" to have different types of cop uniform (other then different colors)</p><p>One other thing that have worked is to start the prompt with "a woman next to a police car". As you can see from some example images.</p><p></p><p>I also tryied to had handcuffs and cop glasses as keywords but they do not seem to work, atleast i didn't manage to let them work. Handcuffs keyword produce nonsense, cop glasses produce normal glasses, even if there are many training images with cop glasses.</p><p></p><p>My mistake might be that i had to do more steps to train something like this, but i'm not sure that it could give a better result.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, problems aside, if you follow the weight instructions, you will end up with some good sexy cop images, Enjoy!<br /><br /><strong><u>If you'd like to support my efforts and have access to early and bleeding edge builds</u></strong>, please think about joining my Patreon: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.patreon.com/betterCuteAsians"><strong>https://www.patreon.com/betterCuteAsians</strong></a></p>
