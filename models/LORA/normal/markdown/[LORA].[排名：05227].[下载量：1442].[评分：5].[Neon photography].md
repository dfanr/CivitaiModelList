<h2><strong><u>Neon Photos LoRA</u></strong></h2><p><strong><u>Contents:</u></strong><u> How to use - Trigger words - Training - Future</u></p><p>This was trained on a set of images using color gels, and neon lights to enhance your capability to produce stylised portraits.  SD models are REALLY bad at this kind of photographic style, this LoRA should help. <a rel="ugc" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/p9btBc7HdTE">Real world example here</a>.  See the sample images for the <strong>simple prompts</strong> used. Tested with Realistic Vision 1.4. I recommend using <strong>Control Net </strong>to help generate your portraits / photos etc. Depth models for poses work really well!</p><h3><strong>How to use:</strong></h3><p><strong><u>LoRA strength:</u></strong> <strong>0.3 to 0.7 </strong>- Higher strengths may produce artifacts</p><p>Should work well with any photo realistic model for <strong><u>portraits</u></strong> (see training), the sample images were made with Realistic Vision V1.4</p><p>This LoRA <strong>WILL</strong> change the shape of faces, backgrounds, and the overall feel of an image, and may produce vastly different results on the same seed.  This is due to the training style.</p><p>I highly recommend using <strong>Control Net</strong> and other tools if you want to regenerate a specific image.</p><p>For generating photos of certain types of people, try to be specific in your descriptions: “Latin female wearing an oversized hoodie” - “Asian male with blue hair” as otherwise you will get similar looking faces.</p><p><u>This LoRA is </u><strong><u>not</u></strong><u> tested or intended for NSFW generations.</u></p><h3><strong>Trigger words:</strong></h3><p><strong>Neon Lights - Blue light - Red light etc.</strong></p><p>Works better with trigger words - Unlikely to generate a similar output without prompting.</p><h3><strong>Training:</strong></h3><p>This LoRA was trained using around 30 photographs which used color gels for flash, neon signs etc.  100% portraits, balanced with various ethnicities, and genders to help produce more varied outputs.  <a rel="ugc" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/msnyz9L6gs4">See example here</a></p><p>For more info on LoRA training check out the channel and video below:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Aitrepreneur"><u>https://www.youtube.com/@Aitrepreneur</u></a></p><div data-youtube-video><iframe allowfullscreen="true" autoplay="false" disablekbcontrols="false" enableiframeapi="false" endtime="0" ivloadpolicy="0" loop="false" modestbranding="false" origin playlist src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7m522D01mh0" start="0" width="640" height="480"></iframe></div><h2>Future:</h2><p><strong>Analog Film Portraits v1.1:</strong> Training on a larger data set with better tagging.  Less aggressive training.</p><p><strong>Neon Lights v1.1:</strong> Will enhance training data and look to include non-portraits to try to upgrade its capability.</p><p><strong>Analog Film landscapes v0.5:</strong> Will train a LoRA on non-portrait images of various film stocks to give more flexibility to image generation.</p><p><strong>Rembrandt Lighting v0.5:</strong> Fairly hard to achieve this kind of lighting in SD with prompting.  Will train on a medium sized data set to try to recreate this famous lighting style of more dramatic portraits.</p><p><strong>Slide Film v0.5:</strong> Slide film has a very obvious color style and grain structure that has always been difficult to replicate digitally.  Will beta test some LoRA training as the weeks move on.</p><p><strong>Street Photography v0.5:</strong> Mostly made using wide angle lenses, and on a variety of subjects.  Will attempt to replicate.</p><p><strong>Studio Fashion photography v0.5:</strong> Fashion photographers shoot in a specific style / angle / focal length, with fairly soft lighting attempting to highlight the clothing rather than the face.  Will attempt to train on various styles.</p><h2>Why this Neon LoRA?:</h2><p>SD is trained on a LOT of images, a cursory glance through the LAION database for “Neon photo” or "Neon portrait" reveals most images are older, lower quality, and over exposed.  Most of the tagging is also fairly poor when it comes to style.  Searching for “Neon Photo” will also just return some really bad examples, with just badly shot images.  SD doesn’t really have a good data set for certain photographic styles, especially professional level photography.  I’m attempting to help SD produce high quality photography in specific styles that will help photographers interested in image generation achieve the look they want.</p><p><strong>Feedback is very welcome</strong>, please leave some comments letting me know what works and what doesn’t for you.  This will be super helpful in training future LoRAs.</p>
