<h2><strong>IronCatLoRA #1 - Artoria Pendragon</strong></h2><p><strong>Making LoRA's is a thing I do for fun. So if you like what I do? You can help me out by just using the LoRA and leaving a review!</strong></p><p></p><p>This is the first ever LoRA I've attempted to make and after firstly a test training run, than a training run with just auto captioned tags, and then finally having pruned the captioned tags and adding keywords. I feel that this LoRA does the job okay/good enough to be uploaded!</p><p></p><p>Artoria Pendragon is one of my first favorite characters from Anime, that's why I decided to make my first LoRA about her. So I hope you enjoy this LoRA!</p><p></p><p>Most images I've uploaded are using the <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/7240/meinamix">MeinaMix</a> checkpoint, since I like the artsy/anime style a lot from that checkpoint. I've tested it on two other checkpoints I like too; <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/24149/mistoonanime">Mistoon_Anime</a> &amp; <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/4437/abyssorangemix2-sfw">AbyssOrangeMix2 - SFW</a>. It seems to also kinda work properly on <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/6424/chilloutmix">ChilloutMix</a>, I've added one example in the images. I've also uploaded two examples where I also use the <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/24718/5shot-style">5Shot - Style LoRA</a>, I've found out with experimenting before I made this LoRA that it creates really cool looking fire effects/"atmosphery" etc when combined with MeinaMix.</p><p></p><p>The main trigger word is <code>artoria pendragon \(fate\)</code>, you can prompt specifically for 3 outfits she wears in the source material, by additionally also using these additional trigger words: <code>armor</code>, <code>dress</code> or <code>suit</code>. Sometimes just using <code>suit</code> will not generate her suit properly, using these additional prompts will help fix that: <code>grey shirt</code>, <code>black necktie</code>, <code>black gloves</code>, <code>pant suit</code> &amp; <code>ponytail</code>. You can also prompt for her specific hair styles by using either <code>braid</code> &amp; <code>hair ribbon</code>/<code>ribbon</code> (optionally <code>hair bun</code>) or <code>ponytail</code>.</p><p></p><p>The LoRA weights I've used in the images I've uploaded are mostly <code>0.7</code>. But this LoRA seems to work okay in a range from <code>0.7</code> to <code>1.0</code>. The LoRA is also trained on her using Excalibur, although it's currently pretty hard to generate an image where she properly holds Excalibur. You can trigger it via <code>excalibur \(fate/stay night\)</code>. Aditionally using <code>sword</code> and <code>holding sword</code> or <code>hands on hilt</code> or <code>glowing sword</code> might also help, increasing the weight of these prompts might also help. The image I've uploaded where she holds Excalibur proper enough, took me a few generations.</p><p>Be sure to also check out my <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/35050">Fate/stay night: UBW Style LoRA</a>, it seems to really work well with this LoRA when using <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/9139/yesmix">YesMix </a>as checkpoint. The Fate/stay night: UBW Style page includes an image posts, where it shows examples of an images using this LoRA with the Fate/stay night: UBW Style LoRA.</p><p><strong>Usage notice:</strong> If you copy the prompts from my images here, make sure you change the LoRA part. In some of my prompt you will see <code>Artoria_Pendragon-000019</code>. But you should change that to, e.g. <code>ironcatlora1Artoria_v10</code> <em>(default filename when you download from here). </em>Or you should change it to whatever you renamed to file too.</p>
