### 三、详情
<p>Yo im back but not really. I'm still trying to grasp how i can improve the quality of my Lora while still retaining a small file size. Maybe that's not possible maybe im asking too much but i will still try.<br />This time I made my favorite Azur Lane Ship Girl. I really wanted to get her default outfit right and not try anything with her skins. This time my main focus was to get the claws right and the other skins might have messed that up.<br />This Lora was nearly only trained on her default outfit so its really bad at generating different outfits (it can still generate bikini or underwear or nudes if you wonder).</p><p>If you use the 30 Epoch version it might look overcooked with some prompts but if remove some you can actually get a good quality with that but its the most consistent when it comes to generating the claws.</p><p>If you don't want claws its kind of RNG you can try something like: "bare hands" or "bare arms" maybe "human hands" will work or putting "mechanical hands" or "claws" or both of them in negatives might also help.</p><p>I tried a lot of different epochs as you can see in the metadata. A few pictures use the 25th and the 15th epoch I think there is also one that uses the 10th epoch but there is not much difference between them.</p><p>Try it out! Maybe you like it but it's not perfect by any means. I will try to find other methods or settings to improve my quality until then I might not upload another Lora.</p><p>Have fun generating and if you have suggestions you can always post them in the comments but i can't promise that they will be released soon because of the aforementioned reason.</p>
