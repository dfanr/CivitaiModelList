<p>My own trained Lora of character Mona from Genshin Impact, I think it's good to have options. </p><p>This is trained on the og anime model NovelAI (animefull-final-pruned) in order for the Lora to be as flexible as posible. </p><p>I've trained it on 40 high quality images hand picked by me and trained at 768x768. It was trained on <strong>Clip skip 2.</strong> So don't forget to set it in your settings before using this Lora for optimal results. </p><p>As trigger words, besides the main trigger word (<strong>mona_tpa</strong>), use <strong>witch hat</strong>, <strong>pantyhose</strong> and/or <strong>star_(symbol) pantyhose</strong> as well for her signature default attire. </p><p>As mentioned above since it was trained on NovelAI model it means it works great on checkpoints based on this model (which are plenty). </p><p>As you will see in the examples provided, it's very easy to change her default outfit. When changing her default outfit sometimes stuff like her hair color or eyes tend to be slighty different than the original. Just use "purple hair" and "aqua eyes" to guide the AI back to her design. </p><p>And ofcourse, NSFW because we're all a bunch of degen.. I mean man and women of culture. I sprinkled NSFW images in the training as well (25% of the images), so you can go to town with NSFW as well. </p><p>Like always with Loras, 1.0 can be overpowering so use weights like 0.7-0.9 for best results. </p><h3>Checkpoints used in the examples: </h3><ul><li><p>AbyssOrange 2 Hardcore </p></li><li><p>AbyssOrange 2 NSFW </p></li><li><p>AnyHentai </p></li><li><p>Anything 3.0 </p></li><li><p>Grapefruit </p></li><li><p>KotosMix </p></li></ul><p>Don't limit yourself only to these, any model based on NAI should produce nice results. </p><p>Feel free to share your creations</p>
