<p><strong><em>V2 Information: </em></strong>V2 should bring much higher compatibility with all non-Anythingv3 checkpoint and allow the Lora to be used much more widely.  Similarly, it should allow the Lora to swap clothes much easier and to have just more general flexibility.  Here are the descriptions for the new tags and pictures that were uploaded.</p><p><strong><em>How to use it: </em></strong>Trigger word is <em>MakotoP5</em>. The LORA strength being ~0.8. Additional triggers that should be used are:</p><p><em>MakotoP5 - </em>Just for her and to allow outfit swap.</p><p><em>MakotoP5, wearing a MetaCL, MetaCL, bodysuit - </em>Gives her the metaverse outfit consistently.</p><p><em>MakotoP5, wearing a CasualCL, CasualCL, long sleeves,</em> <em>vest, black pantyhose, plaid skirt -  </em>Gives her the schoole outfit consistently.</p><p><em>MakotoP5, wearing a DanceCL, DanceCL, short sleeves</em> -<em> </em>Gives her the Dancing All Night outfit consistently.</p><p>Only use MakotoP5 if you want to swap outfits.</p><p><strong><em>Picture Descriptions:</em></strong></p><p>1: Anythingv3 with her Dancing All Night Outfit</p><p>2-3: AbyssOrange with her base outfit and her metaverse outfit.</p><p>4-6: RevAnimated in all the outfits.</p><p>7: Anythingv3 combo'd with my in progress Anime Officer Locon.</p><p>8: Anythingv3 combo'd with my in progress Masked Evil Locon.</p><p>9: Anythingv3 combo'd with my in progress Broken and Defeated Locon.</p><p>10: Anythingv3 combo'd with my in progress Mind Flayer Captured Locon.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>OLD V1 JUST KEPT FOR POSTERITY</strong></p><p><strong>Note #1:</strong><em> </em>This is one of the couple uploads I still have using my old system of making Lora's. Will be updated soon.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>Important:</em></strong> I made this LORA before the one I made for Sae and just forgot to upload it. Since I trained it with some of my older techniques, it is hit or miss with AbyssOrange but works great with Anything, YesMix, Grapefruit, etc. I will get a new version up tried on animefull_final sometime this week to fix it.</p><p></p><p>Time for Sae's sister... Makoto Niijima from P5! It was trained on <strong><em>AnythingV3</em></strong> with 44 images. I also included three outfits you find Makoto commonly wearing, with tags described below I like keeping my prompts simple so that you can see it without a whole bunch of mumbo jumbo. Make your pictures better than mine though!</p><p></p><p><strong><em>What does it do you ask? </em></strong>Makoto Niijima is following her sister and is ready for you entertainment. Inside are three outfits, namely her casual one, her metaverse one, and her P5 Dancing one.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>How to use it: </em></strong>Trigger word is <em>MakotoP5</em>. The LORA strength being ~0.8. Additional triggers that should be used are:</p><p><em>wearing a CasualCL, CasualCL, </em>gives her a casual outfit she wears in the game.</p><p><em>wearing a MetaCL, MetaCL, </em>gives her her metaverse outfit.</p><p><em>wearing a DanceCL, DanceCL, </em>gives her the Dancing All Night outfit.</p><p>Use none of the outfits if you want to give her your own.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>Extra, Extra!: </em></strong>Repeating my info from above since it's relevant here, "Since I trained it with some of my older techniques, it doesn't work well with AbyssOrange but works great with Anything, YesMix, Grapefruit, etc. I will get a new version up tried on animefull_final sometime this week to fix it."</p><p></p><p><strong><em>Picture Descriptions:</em></strong></p><p>1-3: Her base outfits included in this LORA with AnythingV3.</p><p>4-5: Examples of her in other models.</p><p>6: Her in a swimsuit outfit.</p><p>7: Her mixed with my corruption LORA.</p><p>8: Her mixed with my in progress "being stepped on" LORA.</p><p><br /><strong><em>What's next for this? </em></strong>v2 to fix compatibility with other models, specifically AbyssOrange.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>What's next that isn't this?</em></strong></p><p>More character Loras. (Miku + Piscalat from Idaten Deities, Kuribayashi Shino from GATE, Rin Sohma from Fruits Basket, Dominique de Sade from Vanitas, Rebecca Bluegarden from Eden Zero. and Shadow Sae from P5.) Probably Shadow Sae first so I can finish my favorite P5 characters though.</p><p>V2's of some of the previous Loras. Specifically make them more diversely acceptable with other models and LORA's. (Except Sae. She's used my updated methods now).</p><p>I also have some more quite NSFW LORA's. Specifically, being petrified, being stepped on, brainwashing, corruptedv2, and one that might be too much for me to even upload here &gt;.&lt;.</p><p><em>Or just give me some random suggestion. That works too.</em></p>
