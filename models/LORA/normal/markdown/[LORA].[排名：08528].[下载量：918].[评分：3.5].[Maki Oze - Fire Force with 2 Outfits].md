<p><strong>Note #1:</strong><em> </em>This is one of the couple uploads I still have using my old system of making Lora's.  Will be updated soon.</p><p></p><p>A new character LORA, featuring Maki from Fire Force with two separate outfits! This one... For some reason was much tougher to straighten out. I went and bundled two outfits into this LORA and sometimes it takes a couple generations to get exactly what you want, though it should hit with ~80% for the given outfit It was trained on AnythingV3 with 50 images. I <em>definitely</em> need a second version of this one to straighten out the outfits. And I tried to add sputter but it only really appears on her mage outfit right now :(. Also, once in every 10 images she gets blond hair and I'm unsure why (as none of the training images have blond hair... Obviously.)</p><p></p><p><strong><em>What does it do you ask? </em></strong>Makes our friendly girl of muscle, Maki. Using simple prompts so that you can see simple images.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>How to use it: </em></strong>Trigger word is Maki Oze. I prefer the LORA strength being ~0.7. Additional triggers that should be used are:</p><p><em>FFCL AND wearing FFCL </em>(for her black tank top and orange pants)<em> </em><strong><em>or</em></strong><em> MageCL AND wearing MageCL </em>(for her witchy hat outfit). Neither if you want your own outfit for her.</p><p><em>with Sputter</em> was supposed to add Sputter to the image. But it doesn't work well yet after multiple versions. It helps but doesn't mean it will consistently work.</p><p>If you're getting a bunch of witch hats bleeding into your own clothes options, add <em>MageCL </em>to the negative prompts. I'll need to fix this but I don't want to delay v1 any longer after already 4 failed attempts at getting it right.</p><p>If you're getting blond hair and are annoyed by it, add blond hair to the negative prompt.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>Extra, Extra!: </em></strong>The final picture uses controlnet + open pose, so it won't be replicated just via prompt</p><p><br /><strong><em>What's next for this? </em></strong>From above, "I <em>definitely</em> need a second version of this one to straighten out the outfits. And I tried to add sputter but it only really appears on her mage outfit right now :(. Also, once in every 10 images she gets blond hair and I'm unsure why (as none of the training images have blond hair... Obviously.)"</p><p></p><p><strong><em>What's next that isn't this?</em></strong></p><p>More character Lora's. (Miku + Piscalat from Idaten Deities, Kuribayashi Shino from GATE, Rin Sohma from Fruits Basket, Makoto from P5, and Sae + Shadow Sae from P5.)</p><p>I also have some more quite NSFW LORA's that I'm unsure if I should upload. I'll probably upload my brainwashing one, the others... Well.</p><p><em>Or just give me some random suggestion. That works too.</em></p>
