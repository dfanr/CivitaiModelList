<p>Lora model of Medb from Fate Grand Order. Preview images were made with weight 0.7-1. This one actually requires some tinkering with weight and images without highres often show obvious quality drop so highres recommended.</p><p>It's been a while since I made model with this many outfits but I'm happy in general how this worked out. I had some versions of this model that worked more consistentently with default weight and seemed more flexible, but had problems retaining details and in the end I feel this version is a good sweet spot.</p><ul><li><p>First ascension - <strong>medb \(fate\), tiara, fur coat, armor, white elbow gloves, white skirt, white thigh boots</strong>. You can try adding <strong>open coat</strong> to negatives since that's how I intended to get the fully-covered-up look, but I didn't managed to get it to work as well as some fanarts. If you figure out good prompt for that, let me know.</p></li><li><p>Second ascension - <strong>medb \(fate\), tiara, armor, white elbow gloves, white skirt, white boots</strong></p></li><li><p>Third ascension<strong> - medb \(fate\), tiara, white bra, midriff, white elbow gloves, white skirt, white boots</strong></p></li><li><p>Warden outfit - <strong>medb \(fate\), peaked cap, hair bun, red bra, red elbow gloves, midriff, red skirt, red thigh boots</strong>. I feel lower weight of about 0.8 helps here.</p></li><li><p>Full warden uniform (with jacket) - <strong>medb \(fate\), peaked cap, hair bun, military uniform, white gloves, black skirt, red thigh boots</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Grail Live event outfit (white dress) - <strong>medb (fate), white hairband, bare shoulders, white dress, sandals</strong>. This one have simplier tiara so it helps to add regular <strong>tiara </strong>to negatives for more accurate look.</p></li><li><p>First bikini - <strong>medb \(fate\), side ponytail, mini crown, goggles on head, goggles, pink bikini, sandals. </strong>I'm surprised how well this one comes out considering that I only had 3 images, but you do have to dial down the weight to around 0.7. Due to flip augmentation sometimes does twintails.</p></li><li><p>Second bikini - <strong>medb \(fate\), tiara, ribbon choker, twintails, black bikini, gold bracelet, sandals</strong>. Bikini color is full black about half the time sadly.</p></li><li><p>Third bikini - <strong>medb \(fate\), white headwear, pom pom \(clothes\), white bikini, white wristband, uneven legwear</strong>. This outfit probably works worst of all.</p></li><li><p>Knocknarea - <strong>medb \(fate\), simple tiara, frilled collar, black bodysuit, black high heels</strong>.<strong> </strong>Best to add regular <strong>tiara</strong> to negatives because the one used here is different. You can optionally try <strong>fur scarf</strong> - results may vary.</p></li></ul><p></p>
