<p>This is a Lora containing nearly all the skins of Z23 there are 2 missing the Shopkeeper one and the Banquet one. I didn't include them vor 2 reasons. One has only like 5 Pictures and the other would clash too much with existing outfits.</p><p>To get the outfits i added tokens but the tokens alone are not enough to get it to work you have to describe the outfit a bit or it wont show up right. I added the tokens to the trigger word section.</p><p>One example would be: </p><p>If you want the Breezy Doubles outfit but only try black bikini and things like thighstrap you will get the Upgrade Failure outfit most of the time in the wrong color. You would have to add a tag that is unique to the outfit itself like "see-through" to get it</p><p>I also made 3 mistakes while training it.</p><p>The name of one keyword skin is not the actual name of the skin and I included the Idol Skin and the Retrofit Skin in the Dataset of Base Z23 You can still get it but it's not 100% consistent and you have to tag for it aggressively.</p><p>I will redo this in the near future and fix the mistakes but until then have fun with it.  </p>
