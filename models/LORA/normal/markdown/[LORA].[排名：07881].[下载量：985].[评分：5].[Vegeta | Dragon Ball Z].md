<h2>Resource used: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/22530">https://civitai.com/models/22530</a></h2><h3><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://forms.gle/i8n4gr4MBLTBobzP6">This was requested through Google Forms</a></h3><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 0.8 - 1.0</p><p><strong>Trigger + Usual Appearance:</strong> <code>vegeta, black spiked hair, black eyes</code></p><p><strong>Default Outfit:</strong> <code>armor, white gloves</code></p><p><strong>Super Saiyan:</strong> <code>super saiyan, blonde spiked hair, blue eyes</code></p><h3>This next section concerns my thoughts and addresses one of the feedback I had received from my form (and it'll also explain why the file size is larger than usual, but it's <em>loooong</em> read)</h3><p>I first want to start off by saying thank you to everyone that sent requests, left positive reviews, and comments. I have released so many character LoRAs (with a few styles sprinkled in there) in a span of about a week. This is all because I have <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/22530">Hollowstrawberry's Colab</a> to thank for, which is always linked at the top of each model description. I am also able to get out these models so quickly because I have chosen to pay out of my own pocket to get Colab Plus. This is indicative of an addiction as you can tell lol. You should've seen how I scour and work with images (and god forbid, webp files) not typically found on booru sites.</p><p>Now moving on to the one feedback that I received overnight. I received some resources concerning the training parameters of a LoRA model. I of course always use the base NAI model, it's the default setting in Hollowstrawberry's Colab and it's just a click or two away from seeing it. It makes the most sense because then it translates well to other mixed models (that or I am just speaking out of my ass, I just like to generate pictures). Here's the parameters that I used for the Vegeta model:</p><ul><li><p>I had 133 images of Vegeta to work with, all of them taken from Gelbooru using <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/hollowstrawberry/kohya-colab/blob/main/Dataset_Maker.ipynb">Hollowstrawberry's dataset maker</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> 768 (been that way for 95% of all my models)</p></li><li><p><strong>Number of Repeats:</strong> 14 (maybe could've done 20)</p></li><li><p><strong>Epochs:</strong> 3</p></li><li><p><strong>unet_lr:</strong> 1.5e4</p></li><li><p><strong>text_encoder_lr:</strong> 1.5e5</p></li><li><p><strong>lr_scheduler:</strong> cosine_with_restarts</p></li><li><p><strong>lr_scheduler_number:</strong> 3</p></li><li><p><strong>lr_warmup_ratio:</strong> 0.05</p></li><li><p><strong>min_snr_gamma:</strong> checked</p></li><li><p><strong>network dim/network alpha:</strong> 128/64 (went off the guide a bit since the Colab has recommended that alpha is half the dim)</p></li></ul><p>What I had done in my previous models was pretty much left everything as it was in the original Colab. Those gave me good results in <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/18116/citrinedreammix?modelVersionId=21839">CitrineDreamMix</a>. Honestly, if I had a faster computer and more time, I would definitely include more sample images with <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/7240/meinamix">MeinaMix</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/27806/anireality-mix">AniReality-Mix</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/26622/ambientmix-an-anime-style-mix">AmbientMix</a>. I also went back to my <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/43956/clementine-or-overlord">Clementine model</a> and checked the reviews. Some might've not gotten the armor completely right (I think it was the ranking tags that make up the armor? Been a while since I watched Overlord), and some might've lost her features like hair color and eye color (though, I should start saying add <code>this</code> or <code>that</code> if necessary from now on). One of the reviews also affected a part of her armor by removing the breastplate to see her breasts. I <em>try my best for flexibility and customizability</em> for my character LoRAs but I know it doesn't always meet this case whenever I try modern streetwear on a fantasy character.</p><p>Now I pretty much have zero clue on what an overbaked LoRA looks like. I downloaded more than a hundred models since I created this account 3 months ago, and most of them work pretty fine and then I just kinda forget about it afterward. The only hint I got from Googling what an overcooked/overbaked LoRA looks like is the immense sharpening it has on the image, which is the result of overtraining it or something? I should've paid more attention in my machine learning course.</p><p>The resources I got from the feedback, I'm gonna keep it. I was actually going to see if I can bake a LoRA on my laptop (the VRAM's good enough, but the time it'll take to bake isn't amazing as you can imagine). I used those parameters for here and it works fine, so why not on my laptop as well right?</p><p>If you're a reader that made it all the way to the end (or you skipped it, which is fine anyway, you're not missing a whole lot if you don't know anything about training a LoRA, because I don't either!), then leave me your thoughts below! Are the models with the default parameters I worked with fine or do you think the parameters I worked with here are far superior? This shouldn't be of concern to me because I have a terabyte of free space on my hard drive (and 3 more on my other hard drive, but that's for something else entirely), but I'll probably turn back down the network dim and alpha. Helps to save some storage space, but if you want me to leave it alone, just let me know.</p><p>P.S. Since I'm writing a bunch of stuff down here, I'm just gonna announce that I'll be taking a break. Sorta. Kinda. You won't be seeing any releases from me for a while, but know that I am still gathering datasets from your requests (it's usually quick anyway, depending on how much art has been published on Gelbooru). The form is still undergoing revisions. <strong>Again, thanks for all your support!</strong></p><p>P.P.S. Someone requested Aomine Daiki and I was planning to bake a character that shares the same voice actor as him, so... 👀</p>
