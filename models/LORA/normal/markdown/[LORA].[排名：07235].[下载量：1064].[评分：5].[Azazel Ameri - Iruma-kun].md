<p>Updating this to V2 with the biggest change coming around increasing the Lora's ability to be used with other Lora/Locon's, as well as being used in other models.  Added images to show these improvements.  Also, it was trained on animefull_final now instead of AnythingV3.</p><p><strong>Picture Descriptions:</strong></p><p>1-2: AnythingV3 using just this Lora.</p><p>3: AnythingV3 with the Lora and "wearing a business suit" prompt</p><p>4: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Pet Play Locon</p><p>5: AnythingV3 combo'd with my released Brainwashing Locon.</p><p>6: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Symbiote Taking Over Locon.</p><p>7: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress V2Corruption Locon.</p><p>8: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Dominatrix Locon and my in progress being Stepped On Locon.</p><p>9: MeinaPastel with just this Lora.</p><p>10: AbyssOrange with just this Lora.</p><p>11: PerfectWorld using just this Lora.</p><p></p><p>---------------------------------v1 info below and still relevant-----------------------------------</p><p></p><p>One more, more standard, LORA for today! This one is based off another lesser seen character who I love. Specifically, <strong><em>Azazel Ameri</em></strong>, from Iruma-kun. It was trained on AnythingV3 with 56 images. Unsure if I'll have a second version come out for this one, as I think it works well. Let me know for any specific things you may want.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>What does it do you ask? </em></strong>Pretty simple for this one. You put in the LORA, you get back everyone's (well, mine at least) favorite romance manga loving demon girl. Using simple prompts so that you can see it's relatively easy to get a good picture out of this.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>How to use it: </em></strong>Trigger word is AmeriA. I prefer the LORA strength being ~0.7.  I also recommend adding:</p><p><em>AmeriCL, wearing AmeriCL- </em> To push her own outfit more.<br /><em>pink thighhighs, orange high heel boots </em>- These are the main features that are not hyper consistant (the colors blend too much at times), so reminding it will increase consistency.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>Extra, Extra!: </em></strong>Seems relatively easy to change clothes for her (added a swimsuit one for that purpose). After that were two pictures that I used ControlNet + OpenPose to make, so the prompt won't work if you just copy paste it sadly. Finally, the last picture shows combining it with another LORA for clothing -&gt; gothGalArmored_v10. It's an awesome clothing LORA, go grab it yourself!</p><p><br /><strong><em>What's next for this? </em></strong>Unsure if I'll have a second version come out for this one, as I think it works well. Let me know for any specific things you may want.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>What's next that isn't this? </em></strong>Same as my previous upload because it hasn't been a day yet &gt;.&lt;. Probably plan to release a couple more character Loras from Anime (Maki from Fire Force, Miku + Piscalat from Idaten Deities, Makoto from P5, and Sae + Shadow Sae from P5.) Maybe some other more general ones like my corruption LORA (thinking about a brainwashing one). I may also try out Locon's as I've seen they do an even better job than Lora's. <em>Or just give me some random suggestion. That works too.</em></p>
