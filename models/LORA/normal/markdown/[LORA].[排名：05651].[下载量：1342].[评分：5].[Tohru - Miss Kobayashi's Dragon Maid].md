<p><strong>What does it do you ask? </strong>Tohru, the best waifu from Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, was something I really wanted to make as she is the best. So, I made it. I couldn't get myself to use too many of NSFW Locon's in the preview images because I just like her too much as a character lol. Do whatever you want with her of course though.</p><p><strong>How to use it:</strong> First we have the core trigger baked into the Locon.</p><p><em>TohruDM </em>- Main trigger word.</p><p>Also, add either:</p><p><em>WTail or NTail - </em>Depending on if you want to emphasize her tail's existence or not. Note: I am not held responsible for SD trying to put tails in the weirdest spots at times ;9.</p><p>Recommended as well:<br /><em>white pantyhose </em>- The training data tried it's best to add her pantyhose but doesn't always succeed. I'd add this to remind it (and me) of our failings.</p><p><strong>Extra, Extra!:</strong> Should be well trained and usable in most models. Images shown for example.</p><p><strong>Picture Descriptions:</strong></p><p>1-2: AnythingV3 using just this Lora with simpler prompts... And one sad Tohru :(.</p><p>3: AnythingV3 with just this Lora and a business suit prompt.</p><p>4: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Anime Officer-ify Locon.</p><p>5: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Knight-ify Locon.</p><p>6: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress style of Defaultz_17 Locon.</p><p>7: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Brainwashing Machine Locon.</p><p>8: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress PhonePic Locon.</p><p>9: AbyssOrange with just this Lora.</p><p>10: RevAnimated using just this Lora.</p><p>11: PerfectWorld with just this Lora.</p><p><strong>How was it trained?</strong></p><p>It was trained on animefull_final with <strong><em>29</em></strong> images with the usual self-pruning and tagging and a wide range of different images. I like keeping my prompts simple for the first few pictures so that you can see it without a whole bunch of mumbo jumbo. Make your pictures better than mine though!</p><p><strong>What's next for this?</strong></p><p>Should be good to go with this one but let me know of errors.</p><p><strong>What's next that isn't this?</strong></p><p>More character Loras. (<strong><em>Viper and Rupee </em></strong>from Nikke, <strong><em>Spectre Tenebria</em> </strong>from E7, <strong><em>Zephia and Yunaka</em> </strong>from Fire Emblem Engage, <strong><em>Ivy </em></strong>from Soul Calibur 5, <strong><em>Heine </em></strong>from Combatants Will Be Dispatched, <strong><em>Conqueror Lilias</em></strong> from E7, <strong><em>Evelynn </em></strong>from LoL (both base and All Out version), <strong><em>Tharja</em></strong> from Fire Emblem, <strong><em>Laharl-Chan</em></strong> from Disgaea 5, <strong><em>Miku </em></strong>from Idaten Deities, <strong><em>Kuribayashi Shino</em></strong> from GATE, <strong><em>Rin Sohma</em></strong> from Fruits Basket, <strong><em>Kasumi</em></strong> from P5, <strong><em>Ann</em></strong> from P5, <strong><em>Ikumi Mito</em></strong> from Food Wars, <strong><em>Alice Nakiri</em></strong> from Food Wars, <strong><em>Chika Fujiwara</em></strong> from Kaguya-sama, <strong><em>Lulu</em></strong> from FF10, <strong><em>Momo</em></strong> from My Hero, <strong><em>Sheik</em> </strong>from Zelda,<strong><em> Vivy</em></strong> from Vivy, <strong><em>Lucoa </em></strong>from Dragon Maid, <strong><em>Laharl-chan</em> </strong>from Disgaea, <strong><em>Dominique de Sade</em></strong> from Vanitas, and <strong><em>Dos</em></strong> from One Punch Man.) And maybe <strong><em>Wilhelm van Astrea</em></strong>, my favorite Re:Zero husbando or a<strong><em> Prinny</em></strong> from Disgaea.</p><p>V2's of some of the previous Loras. Specifically make them more diversely acceptable with other models and LORA's.</p><p>I also have some more quite NSFW Locon's. I decided to list them as well, so if people have preferences on which to fix up first let me know. Specifically, <strong><em>Beta Censorship</em> </strong>(Automatically censors any images you create to make them BetaSafe), <strong><em>PhonePic</em></strong> (Thisone has been very, very hard... But TLDR, someone holding a nuder version of the waifu on the phone), <strong><em>Demonic Transformation</em></strong>, <strong><em>being stepped on</em></strong>, <strong><em>Robotification</em></strong>, <strong><em>Defeated</em></strong> (decently NSFW defeat scenario for the waifu getting abused), <strong><em>Petrified</em> </strong>(I'm unsure if I should bother with this one anymore)<strong><em>, Infection </em></strong>(this one is VERY nsfw, as the waifu is completely infected)<strong><em>, Dominatrix</em> </strong>(waifu becoming a dominatrix)<strong><em>, Brainwashing Machine, Tentacles, Pillory, Masked Evil </em></strong>(A mask that possess' the waifu)<strong><em>, Latex Corruption, Combat Drone</em> </strong>(hard to describe but basically making them a mindless sci-fi combat warrior)<strong><em>, JAV Supervillain, Jiangshi </em></strong>(Transforms into a Jiangshi)<strong><em>, Mind Flayer Defeat, Blacked, Hypnotized Harem, Hourglass Figure </em></strong><em>(</em>just to make your waifu curvy),<strong><em> </em></strong>and<strong><em> Holding a Leash.</em></strong></p><p>And, uh, I want to make a few "normal" Locon's so I have an "<strong><em>knight-ify</em></strong>" your character one coming up. And a <strong><em>forest fairy </em></strong>one as well. And a <strong><em>officer</em></strong> one. And a <strong><em>barbarian</em></strong> one.</p><p>Additionally, I love the style of <strong><em>Defaultz_17</em></strong>, so I'm making a Locon to mirror that.</p><p><strong><em>Or just give me some random suggestion or priority opinions. That works too.\</em></strong></p><p>I've also added a couple of my extreme NSFW preview images to my twitter (<a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://twitter.com/TwoMoreTimes89">https://twitter.com/TwoMoreTimes89</a>).  Let me know if you think I should work on them more for a submission here.</p>
