(I watched it years ago, and it was nice back then ^^).</p><p>So I went back and watched the first two sessions, and occasionally made screen caps of the characters, because I was thinking: I want to make LoRa available to all the characters that I care about.</p><p>I start the first batch with Star Butterfly the magic crazy girl, in most of her outfits (she changes them quite often, which is nice, considering that this is a western animation series). And the existing LoRa didn't tag the outfits properly, which is the main reason why I created my own ^^.</p><p>Additionally there will be Marco's Mom and Jacky Lynn coming up this weekend, they are currently in training :D</p><p></p><h2 id="heading-60">Training</h2><p>This was fun and due to the fact I wanted to train most of her outfits (there maybe some missing) I ended with 155 images. (v1 had just 128 but I actually forgot to put two more outfit to the training data. So I created v1.1)</p><p>Additionally instead of using repeats I moved to use epochs instead... this way I have way more control over the end result ^^ (But I think I nailed it with 32 epochs ;D)</p><p>This is the first time I've specifically tagged the model for specific outfits, it worked quite well in most cases (first I used deepbooru for tagging, but there was just too much unnecessary junk, so I started from scratch, and although the dataset tag editor helped a lot, it was still a pain).</p><p>Maybe I'll make an updated version to get a bit more training data for the outfits that didn't go so well. I only used the animated series, but maybe fanart / the comics could solve the problem of those missing outfits ^^</p>
