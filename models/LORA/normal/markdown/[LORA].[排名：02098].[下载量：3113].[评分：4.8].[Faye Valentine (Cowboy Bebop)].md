### 三、详情
<h3 id="heading-1893">V3 Description</h3><p>I got pretty lucky with this version because I expected to spend more time on it but the first time I trained turned out with great quality. I trained it one more time hoping to fix some minor issues, but turns out it's better to quit while ahead.</p><p>Prompt for main outfit is <strong><span style="color:#e64980">faye valentine, yellow hairband, yellow crop top, red shirt, off shoulder, tied shirt, suspenders, midriff, yellow shorts, thighhighs, high heel boots</span></strong>. Some poses with red jacket might be problematic because it sometimes becomes obvious that parts around arms and parts around chest are not connected. Adding <strong><span style="color:#e64980">long sleeves</span></strong> can help a bit then. Also if doing open top like I did on second image use <strong><span style="color:#e64980">open clothes, open shirt</span></strong> and put <span style="color:#be4bdb">red shirt, off shoulder, tied shirt </span>into negatives. that helps not just with the shirt, but also separates in middle way better.</p><p>Prompt for bikini is <strong><span style="color:#e64980">faye valentine, eyewear on head, sunglasses, two-tone bikini, o-ring bikini, bracelet</span></strong>. It's still not consistent but good improvement over previous version.</p><h3 id="heading-1894">V2 Description</h3><p>Lora model for Faye Valentine from Cowboy Bebop. Weight worked best for me at around 0.75.</p><p>I'm quite happy with this one. It's v2 because in first version that I made I saw getting the red jacket on and off was pretty lackluster. I decided to put more effort into tagging and the result is while use of model requires more description, control over outfit works consistently. I feel it's probably the easiest to get nice pics with this one out of all of my models so far :D</p><p>Use <strong>faye valentine</strong> in prompt for the character. Tags <strong>yellow shirt, yellow shorts, suspenders, white footwear, thighhighs</strong> will get you outfit without jacket (through how much from it you need depends on you image). For jacket add <strong>red jacket, off shoulder</strong>. Model still occasionally struggle with the way she usually wear the jacket. Sometimes you can get one jacket tied at waist and second one on arms. That's some warm &amp; stylish 4d-chess, through not much desired here.</p><p>There were some singular images of her swimsuit in the dataset, so if you instead do <strong>swimsuit, bikini, highleg</strong>, you have a chance to get half white half black swimsuit.</p>
