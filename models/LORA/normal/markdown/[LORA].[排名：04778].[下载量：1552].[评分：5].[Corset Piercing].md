### 三、详情
<p>A model for corset piercings. I wasn't sure how it'd turn out considering the small data set but I am very impressed.</p><p>Quirks:<br />It will try to lift clothes so I would suggest 'clothes lift' in the negatives. There were only two images with lifted clothes, but with the size of the data set I guess that was a big deal.<br />On rare occasions it will put the zigzag-ing lace on the clothes like an actual corset ignoring the piercing.<br />Corset should go in the negatives to avoid getting them occasionally.<br />The piercing counts as clothes so when trying to prompt nudity with the piercing do '(nude:0.8)' in order to not remove it.</p><p>Things to try:<br />Try placing the piercing where you want it. It will do 'corset piercing on': back, thigh, stomach, or arm.<br />Try changing the color. It does red or black very easily but it can also handle similar colors such as pink or dark blue.<br />Try it on realistic models. From some testing it works well!<br />Try it without prompting for the piercing as it makes cool outfits.<br />Try it with my goth LoRA. The last image was made with both.</p><p>As usual:<br />Trained on Anything v3<br />Demos are Anything v4.5 with LoRA weight 0.8<br />Note the last image is using my Goth LoRA as well in case that was missed earlier<br />NSFW images towards the end of the demos</p><p>If you get any cool gens share them in the comments!</p>
