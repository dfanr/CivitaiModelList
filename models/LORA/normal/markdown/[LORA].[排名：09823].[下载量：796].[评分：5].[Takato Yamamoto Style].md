### 三、详情
<p>This model is based on sd1.5 trained from the picture of Yamamoto Takato, and it is recommended to use weights between 0.6 and 1.1. </p><p>There have been many controversies about the training and use of art style models, but they are also a difficult part to avoid in the process of AI painting progress. </p><p>Therefore, it is recommended to use such art style models as a kind of existence similar to potions, by matching Loras of different art styles with different weights to form images with different styles (although this may lead to bad results, it is worth trying).Alternatively, it can be used to match your favorite character models. Anyway, I hope not to compare it with the artist's own work and make rude remarks, which will harm the community's environment. </p><p>At the same time, there are still many problems to be discovered in this model. In short, hope you have a good time.</p><p></p>
