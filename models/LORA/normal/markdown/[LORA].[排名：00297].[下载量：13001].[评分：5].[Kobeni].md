<p>Update 02/10/2023: Just thought I'd mention that I now have a somewhat better understanding of LoRA training. This LoRA in particular suffers from being overfitted hence why just activating it cause Kobeni to show up. Although you can still get quality generations of Kobeni it may struggle when changing up her style with whatever prompts you may use. I plan to fix it eventually. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Training of Kobeni from Chainsaw Man. I'm just getting into LoRA's so I still lack a ton of knowledge on the different parameters to set when training but I think this LoRA functions decent enough that you can produce quality images of her. This LoRA was generated before I knew how to set up a trigger word for it, so it doesn't have one. Will fix it eventually.</p><p>Just use generic prompts like: 1girl, white shirt, black necktie. etc. when you have the LoRA enabled. I've found that a weight of "0.9 or 1.0" works best.</p><p></p><p>If you're able to make anything good I'd love for you to share. Feedback is appreciated as well.</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Generations sometimes tend to give her 3 hair clips instead of 2.</p></li><li><p>You may also have to prompt for "brown eyes" as it sometimes makes her eyes a red-ish hue.</p></li></ul>
