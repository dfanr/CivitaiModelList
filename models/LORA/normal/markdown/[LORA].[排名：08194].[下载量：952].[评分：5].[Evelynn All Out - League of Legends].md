<p><strong>What does it do you ask? </strong>The sultry demoness from League of Legends realized that why should someone just seduce a person and kill them, when instead you could be a kpop idol and take their money instead? With this Lora I specifically focused on the All Out KDA skin, as IMO it's the best looking one, so that you can use her in whatever stable diffusion concoction you desire. Or, like me, make an image for her so that you a visual aid for your NovelAI adventure &gt;.&lt;.</p><p><strong>How to use it:</strong></p><p>(I use Sampling Method DPM++ SDE Karras and Upscaler R-ESRGAN 4x+ Anime6B).</p><p>0.6 to 1 depending on model/lora/etc combination.</p><p><u>Main Trigger</u></p><p><em>EveylnnAO, skirt - </em>Is what you want to use to get her outfit. Don't use either if you want your own outfits.</p><p><u>Other Useful Tags</u></p><p><em>sunglasses, looking over eyewear</em> - If you want some sunglasses on her so she looks cooler.</p><p><em>yellow eyes - </em>If you want to guarantee the eye color.</p><p><em>Anything Else You Want!</em></p><p><strong>Extra, Extra!:</strong> Should be well trained and usable in most models. Images shown for example.</p><p><strong>Picture Descriptions:</strong></p><p>1: Hassaku with just this Locon.</p><p>2: AnythingV3 with just this Locon.</p><p>3: AbyssOrange with just this Locon.</p><p>4: MeinaMix9 with just this Locon.</p><p>5: RevAnimated with just this Locon.</p><p>6: Perfect World with just this Locon.</p><p>7: ChillOutMix with just this Locon.</p><p>8 AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Ruination Locon.</p><p>9 AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Evil Sailor Scout Locon.</p><p>10: AnythingV3 combo'd with in my progress Censored Locon.</p><p>11: AnythingV3 combo'd with in my progress Slime Transformation Locon.</p><p>12: AnythingV3 combo'd with in my progress Cow Girl Locon.</p><p><strong>How was it trained?</strong></p><p>It was trained on animefull_final with <strong><em>25</em></strong> images with the usual self-pruning and tagging and a wide range of different images. I like keeping my prompts simple for the first few pictures so that you can see it without a whole bunch of mumbo jumbo. Make your pictures better than mine though!</p><p><strong>What's next for this?</strong></p><p>I think it's fine? LMK.</p><p><strong>What's next that isn't this?</strong></p><p>More character Loras. (<strong>Jill Valentine and Ada Wong </strong>from Resident Evil, <strong><em>Elsa and Echidna</em></strong> from Re:Zero, <strong><em>Rupee and Volume </em></strong>from Nikke, <strong><em>Spectre Tenebria</em> </strong>from E7, <strong><em>Zephia</em> </strong>from Fire Emblem Engage, <strong><em>Ivy </em></strong>from Soul Calibur 5, <strong><em>Heine </em></strong>from Combatants Will Be Dispatched, <strong><em>Conqueror Lilias</em></strong> from E7, <strong><em>Evelynn </em></strong>from LoL (base version), <strong><em>Tharja</em></strong> from Fire Emblem, <strong><em>Laharl-Chan</em></strong> from Disgaea 5, <strong><em>Miku </em></strong>from Idaten Deities, <strong><em>Kuribayashi Shino</em></strong> from GATE, <strong><em>Rin Sohma</em></strong> from Fruits Basket, <strong><em>Kasumi</em></strong> from P5, <strong><em>Ikumi Mito</em></strong> from Food Wars, <strong><em>Alice Nakiri</em></strong> from Food Wars, <strong><em>Lulu</em></strong> from FF10, <strong><em>Laharl-chan</em> </strong>from Disgaea, <strong><em>Dominique de Sade</em></strong> from Vanitas, and <strong><em>Dos</em></strong> from One Punch Man.) And maybe <strong><em>Wilhelm van Astrea</em></strong>, my favorite Re:Zero husbando or a<strong><em> Prinny</em></strong> from Disgaea.</p><p>V2's of some of the previous Loras. Specifically make them more diversely acceptable with other models and LORA's.</p><p>I also have some more quite NSFW Locon's. I decided to list them as well, so if people have preferences on which to fix up first let me know. Specifically, <strong><em>Ruination </em></strong>(from League of Legends), <strong><em>Bowsette Transformation </em></strong><em>(Makes your waifu kinda look like Bowsette without changing other aspects)</em><strong>, <em>Fallen Angel</em></strong>, <strong><em>Evil Sailor Scout</em></strong>, <strong>Team Rocket </strong>(Make the waifu a Team Rocket Grunt)<strong>, <em>Pony Bondage </em></strong><em>(specifically with the capability of being "riden"), </em><strong><em>X-ray Vision </em></strong><em>(glasses that give you x-ray vision of a girl), </em><strong><em>Vore </em></strong><em>(Waifu mid-way being eaten specifically)</em>, <strong><em>Revealing Clothes </em></strong>(just makes normal clothing even more revealing), <strong><em>More Brainwashing </em></strong>(in ideation for this still),<strong><em> Slime Corruption </em></strong>(transforms your waifu into a slime girl),<strong> <em>Cowify </em></strong>(Make your waifu into a cow-girl),<em> </em><strong><em>Bound Yuri</em> </strong>(two girls tied up, breast to breast and likely kissing), <strong><em>Tied up with vibrators </em></strong><em>(basically the waifu tied up with vibrators and being overwhelmed with pleasure),</em><strong><em> Beta Censorship</em> </strong>(Automatically censors any images you create to make them BetaSafe), <strong><em>being stepped on</em></strong>, <strong><em>Robotification</em></strong>, <strong><em>Broken and Defeated</em></strong> (decently NSFW defeat scenario for the waifu getting abused), <strong><em>Petrified</em> </strong>(I'm unsure if I should bother with this one anymore)<strong><em>, Infection </em></strong>(this one is VERY nsfw, as the waifu is completely infected)<strong><em>, Tentacles, Pillory, Latex Corruption, Combat Drone</em> </strong>(hard to describe but basically making them a mindless sci-fi combat warrior)<strong><em>, JAV Supervillain, Blacked, Hypnotized Harem, Hourglass Figure </em></strong><em>(</em>just to make your waifu curvy),<strong><em> </em></strong>and<strong><em> Holding a Leash.</em></strong></p><p>And, uh, I want to make a few SFW Locon's so I have a <strong><em>Pirate, Samurai, Tomboy, Delinquent </em></strong><em>(The delinquent girls in japanese schools specifically), </em><strong><em>GoodCop/BadCop </em></strong><em>(Locon with outfits for being a good and for being a bad cop)</em><strong><em>, Maid </em></strong><em>(both normal and naughty variants)</em>, <strong><em>forest fairy</em></strong>, <strong><em>barbarian.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Or just give me some random suggestion or priority opinions. That works too.</em></strong></p><p>I've also added a couple of my extreme NSFW preview images to my twitter (<a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://twitter.com/TwoMoreTimes89">https://twitter.com/TwoMoreTimes89</a>). Let me know if you think I should work on them more for a submission here.</p>
