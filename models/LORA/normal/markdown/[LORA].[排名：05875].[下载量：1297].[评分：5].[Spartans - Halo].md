<p>The spartans from Halo!</p><p>This is a lora trained on 65 hand picked images of the spartans from Halo. It was mostly trained on digital art, with a few 3d images for variety. It was trained on various different suits and helmet types, so results have a lot of variety. It was mostly trained on female spartans, but can do male spartans just as well. It was trained on danbooru-style tags, so use those when trying to prompt - I've included the tags in a .txt file in the "Training Images" download below.</p><p>It works pretty well with most ckpts, but I recommend Anything 4.5, I used it for most of the example images.</p><p><strong>NOTES</strong>:</p><p>-The helmet can be removed if you prompt no helmet, define the facial features, and lower the weight. It wasn't trained on any spartan with their helmets off, however.</p><p>-It will still have issues generating guns/weapons, but it can still kind of work on some models if you're lucky</p><p>-It wasn't trained on any specific spartans, but it can generate a dollar-store version of Master Chief if you prompt it right</p><p></p><p>Example prompt: (See example images, all images should still have their metadata. Just drag the images onto the PNG info tab and import it.)</p>
