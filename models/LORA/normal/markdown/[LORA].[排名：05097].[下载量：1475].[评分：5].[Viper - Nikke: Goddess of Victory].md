<p><strong>Note #1:</strong> Remove the trigger word if you want to change her outfit. It's there to really try to push the outfit while keeping flexibility.</p><p><strong>What does it do you ask? </strong>Viper is the best waifu from Nikke. That's all that has to be said. Is it the fishnets? The skirt? Probably. I think her visuals are just pretty freaking dope and I wanted to make a Lora that let's me use her on multiple (including realistic) models.</p><p><strong>How to use it:</strong></p><p>(I use Sampling Method DPM++ SDE Karras and Upscaler R-ESRGAN 4x+ Anime6B).</p><p>0.9 ~ 1 and trigger word for the base outfit. 0.7 to 0.8 and trigger word removal for changes.</p><p><u>Main Triggers</u></p><p><em>VPRN -</em> Use this if you want her outfit. Don't use if it you want to change her around with costumes.</p><p><u>For Clothing Changes</u></p><p>Remove the trigger word and use 0.6 to 0.7 weight.</p><p>And then whatever else you want!</p><p><strong>Extra, Extra!:</strong> Should be well trained and usable in most models. Images shown for example.</p><p><strong>Picture Descriptions:</strong></p><p>1-2: AnythingV3 with just this Lora.</p><p>3: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Gothic Chick Locon.</p><p>4: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Masked Evil Locon.</p><p>5: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Racer Queen Locon.</p><p>6: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Stepped On Locon.</p><p>7: AnythingV3 combo'd with my released Brainwashing Machine Locon.</p><p>8: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Mind Flayer Mindwipe Locon.</p><p>9: AbyssOrange using just this Lora.</p><p>10: RevAnimated using just this Lora.</p><p>11: ChilloutMix using just this Lora.</p><p><strong>How was it trained?</strong></p><p>It was trained on animefull_final with <strong><em>27</em></strong> images with the usual self-pruning and tagging and a wide range of different images. I like keeping my prompts simple for the first few pictures so that you can see it without a whole bunch of mumbo jumbo. Make your pictures better than mine though!</p><p><strong>What's next for this?</strong></p><p>I think it's fine? LMK.</p><p><strong>What's next that isn't this?</strong></p><p>More character Loras. (<strong><em>Rupee </em></strong>from Nikke, <strong><em>Spectre Tenebria</em> </strong>from E7, <strong><em>Zephia</em> </strong>from Fire Emblem Engage, <strong><em>Ivy </em></strong>from Soul Calibur 5, <strong><em>Heine </em></strong>from Combatants Will Be Dispatched, <strong><em>Conqueror Lilias</em></strong> from E7, <strong><em>Evelynn </em></strong>from LoL (both base and All Out version), <strong><em>Tharja</em></strong> from Fire Emblem, <strong><em>Laharl-Chan</em></strong> from Disgaea 5, <strong><em>Miku </em></strong>from Idaten Deities, <strong><em>Kuribayashi Shino</em></strong> from GATE, <strong><em>Rin Sohma</em></strong> from Fruits Basket, <strong><em>Kasumi</em></strong> from P5, <strong><em>Ann</em></strong> from P5, <strong><em>Ikumi Mito</em></strong> from Food Wars, <strong><em>Alice Nakiri</em></strong> from Food Wars, <strong><em>Chika Fujiwara</em></strong> from Kaguya-sama, <strong><em>Lulu</em></strong> from FF10, <strong><em>Momo</em></strong> from My Hero, <strong><em>Lucoa </em></strong>from Dragon Maid, <strong><em>Laharl-chan</em> </strong>from Disgaea, <strong><em>Dominique de Sade</em></strong> from Vanitas, and <strong><em>Dos</em></strong> from One Punch Man.) And maybe <strong><em>Wilhelm van Astrea</em></strong>, my favorite Re:Zero husbando or a<strong><em> Prinny</em></strong> from Disgaea.</p><p>V2's of some of the previous Loras. Specifically make them more diversely acceptable with other models and LORA's.</p><p>I also have some more quite NSFW Locon's. I decided to list them as well, so if people have preferences on which to fix up first let me know. Specifically, <strong><em>Bound Yuri</em> </strong>(two girls tied up, breast to breast and likely kissing), <strong><em>Sultry Succubus Transformation, Tied up with vibrators </em></strong><em>(basically the waifu tied up with vibrators and being overwhelmed with pleasure),</em><strong><em> Beta Censorship</em> </strong>(Automatically censors any images you create to make them BetaSafe), <strong><em>Demonic Transformation</em></strong>, <strong><em>being stepped on</em></strong>, <strong><em>Robotification</em></strong>, <strong><em>Defeated</em></strong> (decently NSFW defeat scenario for the waifu getting abused), <strong><em>Petrified</em> </strong>(I'm unsure if I should bother with this one anymore)<strong><em>, Infection </em></strong>(this one is VERY nsfw, as the waifu is completely infected)<strong><em>, Dominatrix</em> </strong>(waifu becoming a dominatrix)<strong><em>, Tentacles, Pillory, Masked Evil </em></strong>(A mask that possess' the waifu)<strong><em>, Latex Corruption, Combat Drone</em> </strong>(hard to describe but basically making them a mindless sci-fi combat warrior)<strong><em>, JAV Supervillain, Mind Flayer Defeat, Blacked, Hypnotized Harem, Hourglass Figure </em></strong><em>(</em>just to make your waifu curvy),<strong><em> </em></strong>and<strong><em> Holding a Leash.</em></strong></p><p>And, uh, I want to make a few SFW Locon's so I have a <strong><em>Goth Chick, Delinquent </em></strong><em>(The delinquent girls in japanese schools specifically), </em><strong><em>GoodCop/BadCop </em></strong><em>(Locon with outfits for being a good and for being a bad cop)</em><strong><em>, Maid </em></strong><em>(both normal and naughty variants),</em><strong><em> Biker Chick </em></strong><em>(ride a motorcycle and look like you should)</em><strong><em>, Race Queen </em></strong><em>(Chiling sexily on a car)</em>, <strong><em>forest fairy</em></strong>, <strong><em>Anime Officer</em></strong>, <strong><em>barbarian.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Or just give me some random suggestion or priority opinions. That works too.</em></strong></p><p>I've also added a couple of my extreme NSFW preview images to my twitter (<a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://twitter.com/TwoMoreTimes89">https://twitter.com/TwoMoreTimes89</a>). Let me know if you think I should work on them more for a submission here.</p>
