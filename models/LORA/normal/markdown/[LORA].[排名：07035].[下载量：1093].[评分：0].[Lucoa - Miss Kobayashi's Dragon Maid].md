<p><strong>Note#1: </strong>I trriiiiiiieeeeed to get her iconic eyes but I'm missing something at getting it to work consistently.  I might try again later but I didn't feel like rebuilding it yet again to try to get it to work after multiple tries :(.</p><p><strong>What does it do you ask? </strong>While not as cool as the main characters in Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, Lucoa brings in some hefty proportions to the already gifted members of the cast. And she, of course, is constantly making sure you can't look away from them in the show. With this Lora, her base outfit is defined and the swimsuit one is supported, though not perfect. And, of course, an ability to put her in different outfits.</p><p><strong>How to use it:</strong></p><p>(I use Sampling Method DPM++ SDE Karras and Upscaler R-ESRGAN 4x+ Anime6B).</p><p>0.7 to 1 depending on model/lora/etc combination.</p><p><u>Main Triggers</u></p><p><em>LucoaDM, CasualCL, wearing CasualCL, shorts, tank top, thighhighs - </em>For the base outfit that she wears</p><p><em>LucoaDM, SwimCL, wearing SwimCL - </em>For her swimsuit outfit on the show. This one doesn't work perfectly every time but I figured I should keep it as an option.</p><p><u>Other Stuff</u></p><p><em>Anything else you want to describe the outfit and more!</em></p><p><strong>Extra, Extra!:</strong> Should be well trained and usable in most models. Images shown for example.</p><p><strong>Picture Descriptions:</strong></p><p>1-2: AnythingV3 with just this Lora's base outfit.</p><p>2: AnythingV3 with just this Lora's swimsuit outfit.</p><p>4: AbyssOrange with just this Lora.</p><p>5: RevAnimated with just this Lora.</p><p>8: AnythingV3 combo'd with in my progress Good Cop and Bad Cop Locons.</p><p>10 AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Evil Sailor Scout Locon..</p><p>11: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Team Rocket Grunt Locon.</p><p>12: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Hypno Harem Locon.</p><p>13: AnythingV3 combo'd with my in progress Infected Locon.</p><p><strong>How was it trained?</strong></p><p>It was trained on animefull_final with <strong><em>31</em></strong> images with the usual self-pruning and tagging and a wide range of different images. I like keeping my prompts simple for the first few pictures so that you can see it without a whole bunch of mumbo jumbo. Make your pictures better than mine though!</p><p><strong>What's next for this?</strong></p><p>I think it's fine? LMK.</p><p><strong>What's next that isn't this?</strong></p><p>More character Loras. (<strong>Jill Valentine and Ada Wong </strong>from Resident Evil, <strong><em>Elsa and Echidna</em></strong> from Re:Zero, <strong><em>Rupee and Volume </em></strong>from Nikke, <strong><em>Spectre Tenebria</em> </strong>from E7, <strong><em>Zephia</em> </strong>from Fire Emblem Engage, <strong><em>Ivy </em></strong>from Soul Calibur 5, <strong><em>Heine </em></strong>from Combatants Will Be Dispatched, <strong><em>Conqueror Lilias</em></strong> from E7, <strong><em>Evelynn </em></strong>from LoL (both base and All Out version), <strong><em>Tharja</em></strong> from Fire Emblem, <strong><em>Laharl-Chan</em></strong> from Disgaea 5, <strong><em>Miku </em></strong>from Idaten Deities, <strong><em>Kuribayashi Shino</em></strong> from GATE, <strong><em>Rin Sohma</em></strong> from Fruits Basket, <strong><em>Kasumi</em></strong> from P5, <strong><em>Ikumi Mito</em></strong> from Food Wars, <strong><em>Alice Nakiri</em></strong> from Food Wars, <strong><em>Lulu</em></strong> from FF10, <strong><em>Laharl-chan</em> </strong>from Disgaea, <strong><em>Dominique de Sade</em></strong> from Vanitas, and <strong><em>Dos</em></strong> from One Punch Man.) And maybe <strong><em>Wilhelm van Astrea</em></strong>, my favorite Re:Zero husbando or a<strong><em> Prinny</em></strong> from Disgaea.</p><p>V2's of some of the previous Loras. Specifically make them more diversely acceptable with other models and LORA's.</p><p>I also have some more quite NSFW Locon's. I decided to list them as well, so if people have preferences on which to fix up first let me know. Specifically, <strong><em>Ruination </em></strong>(from League of Legends), <strong><em>Fallen Angel</em></strong>, <strong><em>Evil Sailor Scout</em></strong>, <strong>Team Rocket </strong>(Make the waifu a Team Rocket Grunt)<strong>, <em>Pony Bondage </em></strong><em>(specifically with the capability of being "riden"), </em><strong><em>X-ray Vision </em></strong><em>(glasses that give you x-ray vision of a girl), </em><strong><em>Vore </em></strong><em>(Waifu mid-way being eaten specifically)</em>, <strong><em>Revealing Clothes </em></strong>(just makes normal clothing even more revealing), <strong><em>More Brainwashing </em></strong>(in ideation for this still),<strong><em> Slime Corruption </em></strong>(transforms your waifu into a slime girl),<strong> <em>Cowify </em></strong>(Make your waifu into a cow-girl),<em> </em><strong><em>Bound Yuri</em> </strong>(two girls tied up, breast to breast and likely kissing), <strong><em>Sultry Succubus Transformation, Tied up with vibrators </em></strong><em>(basically the waifu tied up with vibrators and being overwhelmed with pleasure),</em><strong><em> Beta Censorship</em> </strong>(Automatically censors any images you create to make them BetaSafe), <strong><em>being stepped on</em></strong>, <strong><em>Robotification</em></strong>, <strong><em>Broken and Defeated</em></strong> (decently NSFW defeat scenario for the waifu getting abused), <strong><em>Petrified</em> </strong>(I'm unsure if I should bother with this one anymore)<strong><em>, Infection </em></strong>(this one is VERY nsfw, as the waifu is completely infected)<strong><em>, Tentacles, Pillory, Latex Corruption, Combat Drone</em> </strong>(hard to describe but basically making them a mindless sci-fi combat warrior)<strong><em>, JAV Supervillain, Blacked, Hypnotized Harem, Hourglass Figure </em></strong><em>(</em>just to make your waifu curvy),<strong><em> </em></strong>and<strong><em> Holding a Leash.</em></strong></p><p>And, uh, I want to make a few SFW Locon's so I have a <strong><em>Pirate, Samurai, Tomboy, Delinquent </em></strong><em>(The delinquent girls in japanese schools specifically), </em><strong><em>GoodCop/BadCop </em></strong><em>(Locon with outfits for being a good and for being a bad cop)</em><strong><em>, Maid </em></strong><em>(both normal and naughty variants)</em>, <strong><em>forest fairy</em></strong>, <strong><em>barbarian.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Or just give me some random suggestion or priority opinions. That works too.</em></strong></p><p>I've also added a couple of my extreme NSFW preview images to my twitter (<a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://twitter.com/TwoMoreTimes89">https://twitter.com/TwoMoreTimes89</a>). Let me know if you think I should work on them more for a submission here.</p>
