<h3>V2 Description</h3><p>This version is in my experience much superior to V1. When I trained V1 I haven't put much effort, and since my dataset was small anyway I was content with meh result. Here I've used same set on training images but I've put much more effort into it.</p><p>Important thing to note is that this model outputs can differ in style quite a lot even with same prompt and different seeds. They can range from semi-realistic to old school. Personally I love the old school style and I found out you can control it fairly consistently by using <strong>retro artstyle</strong> tag. My preview images have all been made with weight 0.9 and with <strong>retro artstyle</strong> put either in prompt or negative prompt, so you can see what a big different in makes. Whichever you prefer, I advice to put it in one of two prompts for more consistent results.</p><p>Also <strong>retro artstyle</strong> have more accurate dark skin, without it it can be a bit lackluster.</p><p>Apart from that, prompt is pretty much the same - <strong>urd \(aa megami-sama\), facial mark, forehead mark, elbow gloves, choker, bracelet, cape, purple dress, high heels</strong></p><p>Cape often seems to need more weight, but that's about it.</p><h3>V1 Description</h3><p>Lora model of Urd from Aa Megami-Sama. Previews were made with weight 0.85.</p><p>I've been spending too much time on SD so now I wanted to make something simplier and low effort and this is it. There's one outfit and have to struggle a bit for more unusual poses. Details are not very accurate because training set was small. Still for all it's faults, can make nice images also big booba important.</p><p>Prompt for right outfit is <strong>urd \(aa megami-sama\), facial mark, forehead mark, elbow gloves, choker, bracelet, cape, purple dress, high heels</strong></p>
