### 三、详情
<p>Created by <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.fiverr.com/geomanticarts/create-a-lora-of-your-choice">GeomanticArts</a></p><p>This one took a lot of work. This is the 11th training of this particular character. There's just no art of her and training entirely on screenshots gives 1 very fixed outfit and an in-game appearance. Well, that's not what I'm looking for in a LoRA. It should be flexible and allow you to change appearances easily.<br />More or less this accomplishes that. It is -possible- to change outfits here. But it's quite tricky. The clothing is still very 'sticky' to the character and does not change easily. Turning the clothing items to high weights helps, but there are still some pieces of apparel that just don't change no matter what. Anything dress-like will look more like the normal outfit. Definitely not the highest quality LoRA I have uploaded here, but it's a character with very, very little art so it was an interesting challenge nonetheless.</p><p>Example images all made with AOM2-7thV3_C_40 at weight 1</p><p>'Serval Landau [Honkai Star Rail]' - Example prompt for the normal outfit. (sleeveless:1.2) recommended for basically all other appearances unless you want sleeves.</p><p>v15 update - Here's another shot. I nuked the entire dataset. Purged all the tags. Started again. Took some different screenshots. I think this one is better. Still has sticky clothing, but I found it more adjustable than previous attempts. The difficulty is really getting the clothes to change, not to generate the default outfit. Don't specify clothing in particular and you'll get the normal outfit.</p><p>LoRA metadata has all the tags used.</p><p>The trainer's twitter can be found at <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://twitter.com/GeomanticArts">https://twitter.com/GeomanticArts</a></p><p>Trained on NAI.</p>
