<p><strong>Chinese stealth armor</strong>, also known as <strong>Hēi Guǐ </strong>is a set of armor from Fallout 3, and the subsequent games. I really liked this armor and decided to train a lora on it, despite there being VERY little art of this set online.</p><p>This is a lora trained on 32 hand picked images of the Chinese stealth suit from the Fallout series. There are a good amount of 3d renders in this, but the digital art was weighted heavily during training, so it can do digital and realistic pretty well. Despite trained on so few images compared to number of images I usually do, it gets the features really well, and seems to understand how the front and back look. It was trained on danbooru-style tags, so use those when trying to prompt - I've included the tags in a .txt file in the "Training Images" download below.</p><p>It works pretty well with most ckpts, but I recommend Anything 4.5, I used it for most of the example images.</p><p><strong>NOTES</strong>:</p><p>-The helmet can be removed if you put "helmet, faceless" and similar tags in negatives, and also prompt what the characters face is supposed to look like. So this doubles down as just a stealth suit with no helmet if you want to try and put characters in it. See example image for a helmetless character.</p><p>-It was only trained on the "female" version of the armor, however it can generate male characters and body types in it quite well.</p><p></p><p>Example prompt: (See example images, all images should still have their metadata. Just drag the images onto the PNG info tab and import it.)</p><p></p><p><em>Copyright </em>黑鬼<strong><em>™ </em></strong><em>Patent Pending - Hail Chairman Cheng, Glory to China!</em></p>
