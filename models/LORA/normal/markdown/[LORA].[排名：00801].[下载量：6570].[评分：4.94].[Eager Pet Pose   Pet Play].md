<p>Model for poses that involve the character squatting as if they're a pet begging for a treat. Should work reasonably well, even with SFW subject matters.</p><p>Adding <strong>spread legs </strong>to the prompt may also help if you're going at this from a less cutesy angle.</p><p>May leak into unspecific prompts somewhat (presumably the pet in the trigger phrase is somewhat to blame), so be aware that such prompts may result in weird results!</p><p>Otherwise I haven't noticed any particular issues with the character's anatomy when testing, but I'd assume the occasional creature may emerge (although the pose should be relatively straight forward so hopefully anatomy should stay consistent overall).</p><p>This was initially supposed to be called begging pose, but this version turned out to work the best among the ones I've trained so now we're stuck with this stupid activation phrase lol</p>
