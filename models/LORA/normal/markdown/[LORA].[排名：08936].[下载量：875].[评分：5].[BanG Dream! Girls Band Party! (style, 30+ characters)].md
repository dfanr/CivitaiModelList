### 三、详情
<p>A LoRA (Hadamard Product) based on 2396 Girls Band Party cards, recognizing 34 characters to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>A multi-character experiment that turned out better than expected on the first try. Capable of generating multiple subjects, although the consistency still isn't quite there. Decent at hair but often messes up eye colors with multiple subjects.</p><p></p><h2>Usage</h2><p>This Hadamard Product LoRA requires installing <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/a1111-sd-webui-locon">an extra extension</a> to be used in the Web UI.</p><p>The style itself doesn't have a trigger word. For the characters, below are the character tags and respective top 20 related tags.</p><pre><code>Lisa Imai,

No balancing and tag cleaning.</p><p></p><p>The data source also provides info about which other characters are also present in the card art ("cameos"). However, this info is not precise enough, as cards often have two images featuring different characters. Generated tags were used to determine if the cameo characters' names should be included in the caption.</p><p></p><p>The caption template is <code>MainChar/OtherChar1/OtherChar2..., other tags shuffled</code>. Although slashes were used as the character separator, using commas instead doesn't seem to noticeably degrade performance.</p><p></p><p>Trained for 40 epochs but it is not clear if that many were required.
