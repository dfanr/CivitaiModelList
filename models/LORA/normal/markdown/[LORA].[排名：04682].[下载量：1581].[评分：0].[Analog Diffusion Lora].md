### 三、详情
<p>This is not a model I trained, it's seemingly disappeared from Civit, but I received a request to upload it by someone in a comment on one of my models. So any moderators for Civit, please just let me know if I need to remove it.<br /><br />I honestly don't know much about the model, other than I always use 3 words when using it "<strong><u>Analog</u></strong>" "<strong><u>Depth of Field</u></strong>" "<strong><u>Portra 800 film</u></strong>". It was designed to give an analog film look to your images, with the added benefit of having precise control as a lora. I seem to remember these were the trigger words on the initial posting for the lora when it was up, and it always seemed to make the images look much more aesthetic.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I was informed that this lora was extracted from a fully trained checkpoint with the same name "Analog Diffusion" by Wavymulder. Which you can find here!<br /><br /><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/1265/analog-diffusion">https://civitai.com/models/1265/analog-diffusion</a></p>
