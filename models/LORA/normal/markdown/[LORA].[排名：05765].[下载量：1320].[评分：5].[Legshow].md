<p>When you're a cis or bi guy, they say you're either a 'boob man', or a 'butt man', or a 'leg man'. Me ? I'm <strong><u>definitely</u></strong> the latter !!! I don't <em>mind</em> a nice rack nor a shapely derriere, and as a sometime-glamor-photographer I've shot plenty of all three. <br /><br />But show me a set of long, toned legs in a pair of sexy (overpriced) heels, and my heart rate starts going up, my mouth starts going dry, and I find it very hard to focus on anything else.<br /><br />SD is <em>pretty</em> good at giving me my fix of good gams 'out of the box' ... but if you're anything like me, you're probably thinking "yeah, but it could still be <em>better".</em><br /><br />So ... here's my first attempt to address the 'issue'. It's my first working Lora, trained on a set of 244 images of sexy legs, shapely feet, seductive heels, and some appropriate lingerie thrown in. I recommend using a strength of between 0.3-06, and I've found this will generally determine if your shot keeps the rest of your subjects body, or just focuses in on the legs.<em> </em><br /><br />"Legshow" is the magic woid, "heels" or "high heels" also encourage good results. <br /><br />It's definitely not perfect (mixed results with toes, typically require multiple generations, I'm sure inpainting would fix 'em too but hey this is only Week 3 or maybe 4 for me using SD, so proper use of inpainting is <em>waaaay</em> above my skill-level RN haha). I'm sure I'll tweak it some more and update, but pretty happy with it for now ... so ... go nuts :P<br /><br />Tested in a buncha models as with all my releases, and works. Hell ... even Pixar got the legshow treatment and it worked. Yeesh !</p>
