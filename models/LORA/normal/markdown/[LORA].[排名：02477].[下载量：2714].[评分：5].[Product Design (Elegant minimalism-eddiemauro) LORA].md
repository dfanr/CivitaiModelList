### 三、详情
<p>Hi, I’m product and car designer, and I’m so excited to test with AI, I think is a good tool for designing. This tool is so useful for the design process (shapes-ideas generation), but more than that it helps so much to refine aesthetically. I created a basic Lora and tested it with so many kinds of checkpoints, and the result was a different types of "minimalism". If you want to support my work and help me to upload more models (with better quality), you can do it by entering here and donating, I would greatly appreciate it:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://ko-fi.com/eddiemauro">https://ko-fi.com/eddiemauro</a></p><p></p><p><strong>ORIGINAL MODEL:</strong> eddiemauro 1.5 (Checkpoint). Express the minimalism concept. Matte finishing.</p><p><strong>ELEGANT MINIMALIST (Lora):</strong> It is mandatory <u>to use with a checkpoint called</u> "<strong>Szechuan Special Sauce" or "Experience v8"</strong>, so download it first and load inside SD UI (example: Automatic1111):</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/57931/szechuan-special-sauce">https://civitai.com/models/57931/szechuan-special-sauce</a></p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/5952?modelVersionId=32718">https://civitai.com/models/5952?modelVersionId=32718</a></p><p></p><p></p><p>The style is more aggressive and elegant (taken from Szechuan), but it preserves the minimalism style. Also, the colors tend to be darker and opaque. The training dataset is the same as eddiemauro1.5 checkpoint. After a lot of training and testing images, I finally arrived at a stable Lora model to generate product design images and iterations. Recommendation to use this model:</p><ol><li><p><u>It is mandatory to use captions in the prompt: “emauromin style”.</u></p></li><li><p>Clip Skip 2. Go to settings-Stable Diffusion-Clip Skip, and put “2”. I trained model with this option.</p></li><li><p>Generate first some images by changing “Batch size”, select one, and go to img2img mode, duplicate or increase resolution (image size), with “denoise strength” of “0.3 to 0.5”. It is the same process of “hires.fix” in txt2img mode, but you can have more images generated to select. Try to preserve 512x512 (or just 512 in one side) because images are trained at this resolution, and when you change it the model-shapes start gets crazy, even that you can experiment.</p></li><li><p>Use new “extra tool” for enhancing image called <strong>“4x-UltraSharp”</strong>, to increase final resolution.</p></li><li><p><u>Try to use lora level from 0.8 to 1 in the prompt.</u></p></li><li><p>Use ControlNet to generate a more controlled shape of what you want, and even <strong>you can test it with sketches</strong>. <strong>Use Scribble or Lineart ControlNet model</strong><span style="color:rgb(193, 194, 197)">. </span>Some images shown here were created with projects that I have done, if you like, you can take like a base one of my creations: <a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://www.behance.net/eadesign1"><u>https://www.behance.net/eadesign1</u></a></p></li><li><p>You can use this model for whatever you want. If there is another app that is using my model, and you have to pay for it, just let me know. If you use it for merge, I would just ask to contact me.</p></li><li><p>You can download “EasyNegative” embedding and use it.</p></li><li><p>Use VAE 560000 or 840000 of SD model 1.5, to enhance the image created. Sometimes works. <span style="color:rgb(193, 194, 197)">It enhances mostly the contrast and color.</span></p></li><li><p>Use Lora model <strong>"add_detail" (Detail Tweaker) in "-1" value to reduce details,</strong> and sometimes it helps to enhance shape:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="ugc" href="https://civitai.com/models/58390/detail-tweaker-lora-lora">https://civitai.com/models/58390/detail-tweaker-lora-lora</a></p><p></p></li></ol><p><br />The sample images here were created with my model. You have to consider that you have to experiment so much to arrive at these results because it is hard to test just once and get an ideal result. I use Automatic1111 with most used extensions.</p><p></p><p>I trained this model with 100 images with a “minimalistic” style (probably I will train more styles). 75% were products and 22% transportation, from that most of these are speakers, smart robots, water bottles, and others. I will enhance the models by adding 100 more images with a variety of shapes and different types. I realized that these models work so well in vehicle-car shapes, even that if were not so many vehicles in the training dataset.</p><p><br />Example Prompt:</p><p></p><p><strong>Positive prompt: </strong>emauromin style, futuristic armchair, finely detailed, purism, ue 5, a computer rendering, minimalism, octane render, 4k &lt;lora:eddiemauroLora2:0.8&gt;</p><p><strong>Negative prompt:</strong> <span style="color:rgb(193, 194, 197)">EasyNegative, (worst quality:2), (low quality:2), (normal quality:2), lowres, ((monochrome)), ((grayscale)), cropped, text, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, sketch, cartoon, drawing, anime, duplicate, blurry, semi-realistic, out of frame, ugly, deformed</span></p><ul><li><p>Steps, from 20-40 (For EulerA is enough 20, and you can use also DPM++SDE Karras, but EulerA is better mostly)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>CFG scale: 7-8.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>You can follow me on my social networks.
