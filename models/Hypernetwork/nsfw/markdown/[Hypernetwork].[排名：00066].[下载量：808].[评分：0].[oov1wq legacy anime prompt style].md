<p><strong>oov1wq legacy hypernetwork</strong></p><p>This is not my work and I don't plan to support this, just trying to preserve this Hypernetwork for the community.</p><p></p><p><strong>What does it do?</strong></p><p>Makes things more anime-like and seems to push them into the sitting position..? Or maybe it's my imagination.</p><p>It seems <strong>impossible </strong>to make guys with this at 1.0 as well.. it drags everything into 'young anime female' </p><p></p><p>Doesn't seem to have any preference for NSFW but marking it as such just in case.</p><p></p><p><strong>Why though?</strong></p><p><u>If you don't know what this is for or why you want it - you probably don't need it.</u></p><p></p><p>I run into several prompts a day that use this thing and it was impossible to find..</p><p></p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>No idea who made this or what artwork inspired it..</p><p></p>
