<p>IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS!</p><p>This model was trained on SD base 1.5 version BUT It does also work for 1.4 as they both share the same Clip encoder.</p><p>Install instructions.</p><p>Simply place the chimp.pt file inside the \stable-diffusion-webui\models\hypernetworks folder. Load the model inside the Automatic1111 interface under settings hypernetwork.</p><p>Use instructions.</p><p>Use between 0.55-1.0 hypernetwork strength, more strength will give a more real chimpl look while .55 gives a more human form chimp look. I find .7 works well enough.</p><p>Use DPM++ SDE Karras sampler with 15 steps and CFG of 6.0.</p><p>Make sure and always include the word chimp somewhere in the prompt. For people always preface the subject with chimp, example "chimp man walking", "chimp girl playing in the backyard", etc...</p><p>VERY IMPORTANT! Always describe the background in some detail or you WILL get a very generic boring background.. So for example DON'T just say "an old chimp man". DO say "an old chimp man inside a rustic hut".</p><p>Some fun info. People have been sleeping on hypernetworks and I plan to change that. Hopefully the flexibility of this hypernetwok will show everyone their true potential. Because this model is a hypernetwork it can be used in conjunction with ANY model based on the 1.4 CLIP architecture. That means this model will work on any custom 1.4 or 1.5 model, like the modern disney model, or classic disney, etc… for example, let's say you want to load classic disney as base. Well simply load the classic disney model, make sure and preface every prompt with classic disney. As per instructions of the model. Then follow up with my “chimp” tag as instructed once you have loaded the hypernetwork. So the prompt should look something like this “classic disney. chimp girl playing in the backyard.” Make sure and adjust the hypernetwork strength to .5 for a more cartoon look or .7 for a realistic chimp look. Have fun folks!</p>
